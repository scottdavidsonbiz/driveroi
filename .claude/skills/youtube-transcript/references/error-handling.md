## Video Has No Captions

```
This video doesn't have captions or transcripts available. YouTube transcripts require either:
1. Manual captions uploaded by creator
2. Auto-generated captions (not available for all videos)

Options:
- Check if the creator has enabled captions
- Look for an alternate source of the content
- Use audio transcription tools (Whisper, etc.) if you have the video downloaded
```

## Transcript Is Garbled/Poor Quality

```
The auto-generated transcript has some quality issues. Options:
1. I can clean it up as much as possible (may still have errors)
2. You could manually review and edit after extraction
3. We could use a more sophisticated transcription tool if needed

What would you prefer?
