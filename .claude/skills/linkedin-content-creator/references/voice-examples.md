# Voice Examples

Reference examples for tone and style calibration.

## Target Voice Characteristics

**Direct:** Get to the point. No throat-clearing.
**Data-driven:** Use real numbers when available. General observations when not.
**Practical:** Actionable insights, not theory.
**Peer-to-peer:** Talking with equals, not down to an audience.

## Example Structures

### The Observation Post

```
A lot of [companies/people] I talk to [do X].

That's [fine/great/common] — until it isn't.

[Explain why it breaks down]

[What they should do instead]

[Closing insight]
```

**Example:**
```
A lot of B2B companies I talk to rely heavily on referrals.

That's great — until it isn't.

Referrals are unpredictable. You can't control when they come in.

One slow quarter and you're scrambling.

The businesses that grow consistently have a system for finding new clients — not just waiting for the phone to ring.

Referrals should be a bonus, not the whole strategy.
```

### The Test/Data Post

```
I ran a test:

[Setup A]: [Specific numbers]
[Setup B]: [Specific numbers]

[Result] won — [explain why].

Lesson: [Takeaway]

[Practical advice]
```

**Example:**
```
I ran a test:

List A: Highly targeted. 400 emails. 2.7% response rate.
List B: Broader filters. 4,000 emails. 4% response rate.

List B won — both in percentage and total responses.

Lesson: Targeting matters, but volume matters too.

You need enough at-bats to learn what actually resonates.

Don't over-engineer your first list. Get it out there. See what works. Refine.
```

### The Experience/Framework Post

```
[Question or observation]

From my experience:

→ [Point 1]
→ [Point 2]
→ [Point 3]

[Why this matters]

[Takeaway]
```

**Example:**
```
How long does it take to close a deal?

From my experience:

→ SMB: 30-45 days
→ Mid-market: ~3 months
→ Enterprise: 6+ months

A long sales cycle isn't necessarily bad — if the deal size justifies it.

A 6-month cycle for a $500K deal? Fine.
A 6-month cycle for a $5K deal? Problem.

Sales efficiency matters more than speed.
```

### The Contrarian Take Post

```
[Common belief or practice]

Here's the reality:

[Why it's wrong or incomplete]

[What actually matters]
```

**Example:**
```
I've seen teams spend months building attribution models.

Meanwhile, they're not shipping campaigns.

Here's the reality:

Someone sees your LinkedIn post. Gets an email 2 weeks later. Ignores it. Sees you at an event. Books a call.

What gets credit? The event.

But the earlier touches mattered.

Multitouch attribution gives you directional signal. Not precision.

I'd rather move fast and iterate than know exactly where every deal came from.
```

### The Analogy Post

```
[Relatable situation]

[Parallel to your expertise]

[Why hiring experts makes sense]
```

**Example:**
```
You could probably fix your own plumbing.

YouTube exists. Tools are available.

But it's going to take you 10 hours to do what a plumber does in 30 minutes.

Because they've done it 1,000 times. They know which knob to turn.

Same with outbound.

You could figure it out yourself. Build the lists. Write the emails. Set up the tools.

Or you could work with someone who's already made the mistakes and knows what works.

Your call — but your time has a cost too.
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Too preachy:**
```
❌ "You NEED to stop doing X. Here's why..."
✅ "Most companies do X. Here's what I've seen work better..."
```

**Made-up stats:**
```
❌ "80% of B2B companies struggle with..."
❌ "75% of closed deals had viewed an ad first" (unless you actually measured this)
✅ "Most B2B companies I talk to struggle with..."
✅ "In my experience..." or "From what I've seen..."
```
**Important:** Never present hypothetical examples as real data. If you haven't measured it, don't state it as fact. Use qualifiers like "imagine if..." or "what if you could see..." for hypotheticals.

**Humble-brag:**
```
❌ "With my years of enterprise experience, I've learned..."
✅ [Just share the insight. The experience shows through the content.]
```

**Generic advice:**
```
❌ "Focus on your ideal customer profile."
✅ "We built a list of 100 accounts that matched three criteria: [specific criteria]"
```

**CTA on every post:**
```
❌ "DM me if you want help with this!"
✅ [Only add CTA when specifically appropriate, like an offer post]
```
