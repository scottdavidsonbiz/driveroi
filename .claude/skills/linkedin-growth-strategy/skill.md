# LinkedIn Growth Strategy Skill

**Version:** 2.0.0 (Updated December 2025)
**Purpose:** Apply systematic LinkedIn growth framework to content creation and audience building
**Based on:** Adam Robinson's "0 to 100K Followers" methodology + Premium GTM positioning

## What This Skill Does

Helps you:
1. Create LinkedIn content using proven frameworks
2. Develop strategic engagement plans
3. Build qualified connections systematically
4. Track growth metrics that matter
5. Convert LinkedIn presence into business outcomes

## The 6-Step Framework

### Step 1: Develop Your Story
**Goal:** Make your target market feel seen

**Key questions to answer:**
- Who are you? (background, expertise)
- What niche do you serve? (specific ICP)
- What do you stand for? (unique positioning)

**Output:** Clear positioning statement that resonates with ICP pain points

### Step 2: Perfect Your Profile
**Goal:** Maximize credibility through strategic optimization

**Key elements:**
- **Headline:** Value proposition, not just title
- **About section:** Problem → Solution → Proof
- **Featured:** Case studies, testimonials, best content
- **Experience:** Frame as outcomes, not responsibilities

### Step 3: Create Best-in-Class Content
**Goal:** Consistent content using proven frameworks

**Core principles:**
- **Prolific Index:** Combine unique insights with mainstream ideas
- **Consistency:** 3-5x per week for sustainable growth
- **Mix formats:** Tactical tips, insights, stories
- **Content pillars:** 4-6 core topics you're known for

**When creating content, ask:**
- Does this make my ICP feel seen?
- Is there a unique angle (not generic advice)?
- Would someone share this or save it?

### Step 4: Growth Strategies & Tactics
**Goal:** Strategic engagement to accelerate growth

**Key tactics:**
- **Connection campaigns:** 100-250 ideal prospects
- **Engagement strategy:** Comment on influencer posts for visibility
- **DM approach:** Provide value first, ask for nothing
- **Collaboration:** Tag relevant people, amplify others

**Connection sequence:**
1. Engage with their content 2-3 times first
2. Send personalized connection request
3. Continue engaging after connection
4. Provide value via DM when relevant
5. Move to call after 3-5 quality interactions

### Step 5: Build Community Through Commenting
**Goal:** Use strategic commenting to build relationships

**Best practices:**
- Comment early (first 2 hours = max visibility)
- Add value, don't just say "Great post!"
- Build relationships in comments → DMs → calls
- Maintain "commenting list" of 50-100 ideal prospects

**Comment framework:**
1. Agree/acknowledge the point
2. Add unique insight or example
3. Ask thoughtful question

### Step 6: Use Video for Deeper Connection
**Goal:** Create deeper trust through video

**Start simple:**
- Phone camera, natural lighting
- 30-90 seconds (short form performs well)
- Hook in first 3 seconds
- Clear CTA at end

**Video types:**
- Tool tutorials (screen recordings)
- Behind the scenes
- Hot takes on industry news
- Client wins (anonymized)

## Step-by-Step Process

### When Creating Content

1. **Choose content pillar** (which expertise area?)
2. **Select format** (tactical tip, insight, or story?)
3. **Apply Prolific Index:**
   - Mainstream idea: What everyone knows
   - Unique angle: Your contrarian take or specific example
4. **Write hook** (first line must grab attention)
5. **Deliver value** (tactical, insightful, or relatable)
6. **End with engagement** (question, CTA, or thought-provoking statement)

### When Planning Engagement Strategy

1. **Build target list** (100 ideal prospects to connect with)
2. **Create commenting list** (50 prospects + influencers to engage with)
3. **Set daily routine:**
   - 10-15 meaningful comments
   - 3-5 connection requests (after engaging with their content)
   - Respond to all comments on your posts
4. **Track what matters** (see `references/metrics-tracking.md`)

### When Optimizing Strategy

1. **Review top/bottom performing content** (what worked? what didn't?)
2. **Analyze connection acceptance rate** (is messaging resonating?)
3. **Track comment → DM → call conversion** (is engagement moving off-platform?)
4. **Adjust content pillars** (double down on winners)

## CRITICAL: Authenticity & Truth Requirements

**NEVER fabricate or make up:**
- ❌ Statistics or percentages that didn't happen
- ❌ Client stories that aren't real
- ❌ Revenue numbers or metrics you don't have
- ❌ Quotes from people who didn't say them
- ❌ Results from work you didn't do

**ALWAYS use:**
- ✅ Real examples from your actual work
- ✅ General observations (e.g., "Most companies struggle with..." not "47% of companies...")
- ✅ Clearly hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "Imagine if..." or "What if...")
- ✅ Qualitative statements (e.g., "significantly faster" not "40% faster" unless you measured it)
- ✅ Your genuine opinions and frameworks

**If you don't have real data:**
- Use "typically" or "often" instead of specific percentages
- Tell stories as hypotheticals or composites (label them as such)
- Focus on frameworks and principles, not fabricated proof points

Authenticity builds trust. Fake statistics destroy credibility.

## Quality Checks

Before posting, ask:
- [ ] Does this align with my positioning/story?
- [ ] Is there a unique angle (not generic advice)?
- [ ] Would my ICP find this valuable?
- [ ] Does the hook grab attention in first line?
- [ ] Is there a clear takeaway or action?
- [ ] **Are all statistics, stories, and examples real or clearly labeled as hypothetical?**

Before connecting, ask:
- [ ] Have I engaged with their content 2-3 times?
- [ ] Is my connection message personalized?
- [ ] Am I offering value, not asking for something?

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Creating LinkedIn content (any post, article, comment)
- Planning LinkedIn strategy or content calendar
- Optimizing LinkedIn profile
- Building engagement or connection campaigns
- Analyzing LinkedIn performance
- Converting LinkedIn presence to business outcomes

Don't use this skill when:
- Creating content for other platforms (different algorithms/formats)
- Doing one-off LinkedIn messages (too heavyweight)

## Success Criteria

**Short-term (Month 1-3):**
- Posting consistency (3-5x per week)
- Growing engagement rate (comments, profile views)
- 50-100 qualified connections added

**Medium-term (Month 4-6):**
- 10+ discovery calls from LinkedIn
- Clear top-performing content types identified
- Community building (regular commenters on your posts)

**Long-term (Month 7-12):**
- LinkedIn-sourced revenue
- Recognized as thought leader in niche
- Inbound leads from content

## Notes for Improvement

Tell user if:
- Framework doesn't fit your business model
- Content ideas don't resonate with your ICP
- Engagement tactics feel inauthentic
- Metrics tracking needs different focus areas
