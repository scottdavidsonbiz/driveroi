# LinkedIn Content Ideas & Examples

## Content Pillars Framework

Structure your content around 4-6 core topics you want to be known for:

**Example for Drive ROI:**
1. **RevOps Strategy** - ICP definition, territory planning, capacity modeling
2. **GTM Automation** - Clay workflows, intent data, sequencing tactics
3. **Revenue Analytics** - Pipeline forecasting, board reporting, KPI frameworks
4. **Finance + GTM** - How FP&A thinking improves revenue operations
5. **Founder Stories** - Lessons from modernizing legacy businesses

**Example for General Consultant:**
1. Your methodology/framework
2. Industry insights
3. Client transformations
4. Tactical how-tos
5. Personal lessons/failures

## Content Format Mix

### Format 1: Tactical Posts (High Engagement)
**Goal:** Actionable, save-worthy content

**Examples for Drive ROI:**
- "The 5-minute Clay waterfall that replaced our $15K/year ZoomInfo subscription"
- "How to build a board-ready pipeline dashboard in Google Sheets (when you can't afford Salesforce)"
- "3 RevOps mistakes that make CFOs cringe (and how to fix them)"
- "The exact lead scoring formula I use for PE portfolio companies"
- "Why founder-led businesses fail at LinkedIn (and how to fix it in 1 hour)"

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Problem or surprising claim
2. Context: Why this matters
3. Solution: Step-by-step or framework
4. CTA: Save this, share with your team, DM for template

### Format 2: Insight Posts (Thought Leadership)
**Goal:** Showcase unique perspective

**Examples for Drive ROI:**
- "PE firms are finally realizing RevOps isn't just 'CRM admin' - here's what changed"
- "The RevOps + FP&A gap: Why most revenue operations miss the financial planning piece"
- "I analyzed 50 Series B SaaS companies. Only 3 had board-ready analytics. Here's why."
- "Finance SaaS companies need RevOps consultants who understand finance. Here's the problem: they don't exist."
- "Founder-led legacy businesses are 10 years behind on GTM. That's actually the opportunity."

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Observation or data point
2. Analysis: Why this pattern exists
3. Implication: What this means for your ICP
4. CTA: Thought-provoking question or debate

### Format 3: Story Posts (Personal Connection)
**Goal:** Build human connection and trust

**Examples for Drive ROI:**
- "I just watched a $20M consulting firm close deals with cold calls and Google Sheets. Here's what I learned."
- "My first client rejected my proposal. Then came back 3 months later and paid 2x. Here's why."
- "I spent 5 years at 6sense doing FP&A for a $200M ARR company. Here's the one thing no one talks about."
- "Partner announcement: Why Brenda and I are building the first RevOps + Analytics partnership for PE portfolios"
- "Every PE firm says they 'help with go-to-market.' Here's what actually happens (and what we're doing different)."

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Compelling story opening
2. Story: What happened (with specific details)
3. Lesson: What you learned
4. Application: How readers can apply this

## Prolific Index Framework

**Concept:** Combine mainstream ideas (everyone agrees) with unique insights (your contrarian take)

**Examples:**

**Mainstream:** "You need a CRM"
**Unique:** "Most SaaS companies use CRMs built for yesterday's playbook. Here's how PE portfolios are rebuilding from scratch with AI-first infrastructure."

**Mainstream:** "Content marketing is important"
**Unique:** "Everyone says 'provide value' on LinkedIn. Here's why 90% of LinkedIn content is forgettable - and the 3-minute test I use to fix it."

**Mainstream:** "Know your ICP"
**Unique:** "Most founders define their ICP too broadly. I helped a client go from '15-50 person SaaS companies' to 'Series B finance/accounting SaaS with 20-40 employees who just hired their first RevOps person.' Their close rate went from 12% to 47%."

## Hook Formulas That Work

1. **The Surprising Stat:** "I analyzed 50 [target companies] and found..."
2. **The Contrarian Take:** "Everyone says [mainstream advice]. Here's why that's wrong..."
3. **The Personal Story:** "I just [surprising experience]. Here's what I learned..."
4. **The Problem → Solution:** "If you're struggling with [problem], here's..."
5. **The List:** "3 [mistakes/tips/secrets] that [outcome]..."
6. **The Before/After:** "A year ago I was [before]. Today I'm [after]. Here's what changed..."

## Content Repurposing Ideas

**From one client insight, create:**
1. LinkedIn post with key lesson
2. Detailed article breaking down the framework
3. Thread with step-by-step process
4. Video explaining the concept
5. Case study (when client approves)

**From video content, create:**
1. Transcript → LinkedIn article
2. Key moments → Short posts
3. Quotes → Image posts
4. Full video → Native LinkedIn video

## Topics to Avoid

- Generic motivation ("Believe in yourself!")
- Obvious advice ("Work hard and succeed")
- Complaints without solutions
- Anything off-brand for your positioning
- Topics outside your expertise

## Content Research Process

1. **Study competitors:** Save 20-30 posts from top creators in your space
2. **Identify patterns:** What formats work? What topics get engagement?
3. **Find gaps:** What's everyone saying? What's missing?
4. **Add unique angle:** How can you say it differently/better?

## Engagement Boosters

- **Ask questions:** End posts with thought-provoking questions
- **Tag thoughtfully:** Mention relevant people (but don't overdo it)
- **Use line breaks:** Make posts scannable
- **First comment:** Add additional context in first comment
- **Reply to everyone:** Engage with all comments in first 2 hours
