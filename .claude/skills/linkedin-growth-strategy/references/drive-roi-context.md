## Commenting Strategy Examples

**On PE firm post about portfolio growth:**
"This resonates. We're seeing the same with Series B portfolios—they have CRM but not analytics infrastructure. The gap between GTM data and board reporting creates blind spots. Curious: Are you standardizing RevOps playbooks across portfolio companies or letting each find their own path? We've found standardization (with flexibility) works better for benchmarking."

**On international founder post about US expansion:**
"Classic mistake. Most international companies hire a US VP Sales before validating their ICP works in the US market. Then burn $200K in salary + 9 months learning it doesn't. We run the validation first (30-50 US meetings in 3-6 months), then you hire with confidence. Brenda's Dell experience across 30 countries taught us: prove the market, then scale the team."

**On vertical SaaS CEO post about GTM challenges:**
"Finance software is unique—your buyers (CFOs) care about ROI/payback/TCO in ways that other verticals don't. Most RevOps consultants treat it like generic B2B SaaS. Scott's FP&A background from 6sense means we literally ARE your buyer persona. Happy to share what we're seeing work for CFO tools if helpful."

2. **Send connection request** with personalized message (reference their content)
3. **Continue engaging** after connection (1-2 more interactions)
4. **Value-first DM** (share relevant insight, case study, or offer free audit)
5. **Propose brief call** ("15-min chat to share what we're seeing in [their segment]")
6. **Discovery call** → Proposal → Close

**Goal:** 10-15 LinkedIn connections → 3-5 discovery calls per month
