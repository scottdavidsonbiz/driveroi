# ICP Lead Research & Generation Skill

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Purpose:** Research a company's ICP and generate highly-targeted lead lists based on case studies, strategic priorities, and recent announcements
**Output:** 25+ qualified ICP accounts with scoring, pain points, and strategic alignment

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you create high-quality, **non-obvious** lead lists for clients by:
1. Analyzing their case studies to identify customer patterns
2. Researching recent company news, funding, and strategic priorities
3. Identifying target industries, company stages, and pain points
4. Generating 25+ scored prospect accounts with specific qualifying signals
5. **Focusing on less well-known, mid-market companies (NOT Fortune 500 or household names)**
6. Creating an ICP summary document with buyer personas and messaging angles

**CRITICAL:** These are NON-OBVIOUS prospects that the client likely hasn't identified themselves. Avoid:
- Fortune 500 companies
- Household name brands (Salesforce, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)
- Companies everyone in the industry already knows and targets
- Mega-enterprises with 10,000+ employees that are saturated with sales outreach

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- A client asks for "25 ICP accounts" or lead list
- You need to research a company's ideal customer profile
- Creating targeted prospect lists for outbound campaigns
- Analyzing a company's market positioning and customer base
- Building account-based marketing (ABM) target lists

Don't use this skill when:
- Client already has a defined ICP (use for validation only)
- Need is for content creation, not lead generation
- Request is for competitive analysis (different process)

## The Research Framework

### Step 1: Case Study Analysis
**Goal:** Identify customer patterns from real wins

**What to extract:**
- Company names and industries from case studies
- Company sizes (employees, revenue if mentioned)
- Key pain points and challenges mentioned
- Solutions implemented and use cases
- Outcomes and results (ROI, time savings, cost reduction)
- Common patterns across multiple case studies

**Key questions:**
- What industries appear most frequently?
- What company sizes do they typically serve?
- What pain points are mentioned repeatedly?
- What outcomes do customers care about most?

### Step 2: Strategic Priorities Research
**Goal:** Understand current company focus and direction

**Sources to check:**
- Company homepage (value prop, target market)
- Recent press releases and announcements
- Funding news (Series, investors, use of funds)
- Product launches and partnerships
- Conference presence and speaking engagements
- Job postings (hiring for which markets/roles?)

**What to identify:**
- Recent funding (last 12-24 months)
- New product launches or features
- Geographic expansion plans
- Partnership announcements
- Industry focus areas
- Technology priorities (AI, automation, etc.)

### Step 3: ICP Definition
**Goal:** Create clear ideal customer profile criteria

**Define:**
- **Industries:** Top 3-5 vertical markets
- **Company Stage:** Revenue range, funding stage, employee count
- **Pain Points:** Top 3-5 problems they solve
- **Buying Triggers:** Events that create urgency
- **Budget Signals:** Funding, growth, expansion indicators
- **Geographic Focus:** Regions they serve/prioritize

**Anti-ICP (who NOT to target):**
- Company sizes too small/large
- Industries with poor fit
- Geographic limitations
- Budget constraints

### Step 4: Lead Generation
**Goal:** Find 25+ companies matching ICP with active buying signals

**CRITICAL RULE: Focus on NON-OBVIOUS Prospects**

**DO NOT INCLUDE:**
❌ Fortune 500 companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, etc.)
❌ Household name brands everyone knows (Nike, Coca-Cola, Disney, etc.)
❌ Mega-enterprises with 50,000+ employees
❌ Companies that are saturated with sales outreach
❌ "Obvious" targets in the industry that everyone pursues

**DO INCLUDE:**
✅ Series B/C/D funded companies ($10M-$200M raised)
✅ Mid-market companies ($10M-$500M revenue)
✅ Fast-growing companies not yet household names
✅ Regional leaders expanding nationally
✅ International companies entering US market
✅ Companies at inflection points (just raised funding, just launched product)

**Search for companies with:**
- **Industry match:** In target verticals
- **Growth signals:** Recent funding, revenue milestones, hiring
- **Pain point indicators:** Job postings, conference talks, case studies
- **Strategic initiatives:** Product launches, market expansion, partnerships
- **Budget signals:** Series B/C/D funding, M&A, new offices
- **Non-obvious profile:** Not Fortune 500 or mega-brands

**Prioritize companies with:**
- Multiple qualifying signals (stack the odds)
- Recent trigger events (timing matters)
- Public announcements (easier to personalize)
- **Less than 5,000 employees** (sweet spot: 100-2,000)
- **Series B to Pre-IPO stage** (not early startups, not mega-corps)
- Strategic alignment with client's recent priorities

**Scoring criteria (1-10):**
- 10: Perfect fit, multiple trigger events, urgent need
- 8-9: Strong fit, 2-3 qualifying signals, good timing
- 6-7: Good fit, 1-2 signals, moderate priority
- 5 or below: Don't include (raise the bar)

### Step 5: Documentation
**Goal:** Create actionable deliverables for client

**Create two files:**

1. **CSV with leads** (columns):
   - Account Name
   - Domain
   - Industry Category
   - Score (1-10)
   - Funding Stage/Recent Funding
   - Reason for Inclusion
   - Specific Pain Point / Trigger
   - Strategic Alignment
   - Budget Signal

2. **ICP Summary Document** (markdown):
   - Company overview (size, focus, differentiation)
   - 2024-2025 strategic priorities
   - ICP definition (industries, sizes, pain points)
   - Buyer personas (titles, pain points, motivations)
   - Key messaging angles by vertical
   - Qualifying questions to ask
   - Anti-ICP criteria
   - Sources and references

## Step-by-Step Process

### When Starting Research

1. **Gather URLs:**
   - Case studies page
   - Company homepage
   - Recent press releases/news

2. **Extract case study data:**
   - List all customer names and industries
   - Note common pain points across case studies
   - Identify typical company sizes mentioned
   - Document key outcomes and ROI metrics

3. **Research strategic focus:**
   - Search "[Company] news 2024 2025 announcements"
   - Search "[Company] funding Series priorities"
   - Check company blog for recent posts
   - Review leadership LinkedIn posts

4. **Define ICP criteria:**
   - Industries: Top 3-5 from case studies
   - Company stage: Based on case study sizes
   - Pain points: Most common across case studies
   - Buying triggers: What creates urgency?

### When Generating Leads

1. **Search by vertical + signals:**
   - "[Industry] Series B C funding 2024 2025"
   - "[Industry] companies scaling growth 2024"
   - "[Pain point] [Industry] executives discussing"

2. **For each prospect, document:**
   - Why they fit ICP (industry, size, stage)
   - Specific trigger event (funding, expansion, hire)
   - Pain point evidence (job posting, conference talk, press release)
   - Strategic alignment (how they match client priorities)
   - Budget signal (funding amount, growth rate, customer count)

3. **Score leads 1-10:**
   - 10: Multiple triggers, perfect timing, urgent need
   - 8-9: Strong fit, 2-3 signals, good timing
   - 6-7: Good fit, 1-2 signals
   - Don't include scores below 6

4. **Quality over quantity:**
   - Better to have 20 perfect fits than 50 mediocre ones
   - Non-obvious prospects > Fortune 500 everyone targets
   - Recent trigger events > static firmographics
   - Specific pain points > generic assumptions

### When Documenting Findings

1. **Create CSV first:**
   - Use consistent column headers
   - Score each lead 1-10
   - Include specific, recent triggers
   - Cite sources where possible

2. **Write ICP summary:**
   - Start with company overview and priorities
   - Define ICP clearly (industries, sizes, triggers)
   - Include buyer personas with motivations
   - Add messaging angles by vertical
   - List qualifying questions
   - Document anti-ICP criteria
   - Cite all sources

3. **Save outputs:**
   - CSV: `[company-name]-leads-[number].csv`
   - Summary: `[company-name]-icp-summary.md`
   - Location: `Client Lead Magnets/` folder

## Quality Checks

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] All 25+ leads have scores 6 or higher
- [ ] Each lead has specific trigger event (not generic)
- [ ] Industries match case study patterns
- [ ] Recent signals cited (2024-2025, not old news)
- [ ] Non-obvious prospects (not Fortune 500 everyone knows)
- [ ] Strategic alignment explained for each lead
- [ ] Budget signals documented
- [ ] ICP summary includes buyer personas
- [ ] All sources cited with links
- [ ] Files saved to correct folder

## Common Patterns to Look For

**In Case Studies:**
- Industries appearing 3+ times = core vertical
- Pain points mentioned in multiple case studies = primary value prop
- Outcomes with specific metrics = key messaging angles
- Company sizes mentioned = ICP stage definition

**In Strategic Priorities:**
- Recent funding = expansion mode, budget available
- Product launches = new market/use case focus
- Partnerships = channel or technology priority
- Geographic expansion = new regional focus
- Conference presence = industry/vertical priority

**In Lead Research:**
- Series B/C/D funding (last 12 months) = budget signal
- VP/Director hiring for [function] = pain point indicator
- Conference speaking about [topic] = active problem discussion
- Product launch in [area] = strategic initiative
- Partnership announced with [company] = expansion signal

## Tips for Excellence

**Research depth:**
- Spend 15-30 minutes per lead researching triggers
- Stack multiple signals (funding + expansion + pain point)
- Recent = last 6-12 months, not 3 years ago
- Cite specific sources (press releases, LinkedIn posts)

**Strategic alignment:**
- Map leads to client's 2024-2025 priorities
- Connect to their case study patterns
- Show how timing is perfect (RE+ conference, partnership launch)
- Explain why THIS lead, not generic fit

**Non-obvious prospects (CRITICAL):**
- **NEVER include Fortune 500** (they're already being targeted by everyone)
- **NEVER include mega-brands** (Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc.)
- Focus on **Series B-D** (funded but not yet household names)
- Look for **emerging players** in established markets (not the market leaders)
- Find **regional champions** expanding nationally (not national brands going global)
- Target **international companies** entering US (not US giants going international)
- Prioritize **mid-market growth companies** (100-2,000 employees, not 10,000+)
- Find companies **at inflection points** (just raised funding, just launched product, just opened new office)

**Trigger events matter more than firmographics:**
- Just raised Series C = better than "matches ICP size"
- Just hired VP of [X] = active pain point
- Just announced partnership = strategic shift
- Just launched in new market = expansion mode

## Notes for Improvement

Tell user if:
- Case studies don't reveal clear patterns (need more context)
- Strategic priorities unclear (need additional research sources)
- Lead quality below threshold (raise scoring criteria)
- Anti-ICP needs refinement (missing exclusion criteria)
