# Cold Email Outreach Skill



**Version:** 1.0.0

**Purpose:** Generate effective cold email sequences using proven frameworks

**Based on:** CLI Acquire's "Tell The Full Story" methodology



## What This Skill Does



Takes business information and generates:

1. Targeted opening emails that "tell the whole story"

2. Follow-up/bump emails for sequences

3. Multiple variations for A/B testing

4. Subject lines optimized for open rates



**Key principle:** Each opening email should work as a standalone piece, focusing on ONE combination of Market Segment → Persona → Pain → Angle.



## Step-by-Step Process



### Step 1: Gather Information



**Required inputs:**

- Business description or website URL

- What the business does (product/service)

- What problem they solve



**Optional but helpful:**

- ICP definition (who do they sell to?)

- Persona details (role, responsibilities, pain points)

- Current positioning/messaging

- Competitive differentiation

- Case studies or proof points



**If website URL provided:**

1. Visit the website

2. Extract key information:

   - What they sell

   - Who they serve

   - Key value propositions

   - Social proof (customers, results)

   - Industry/vertical focus



### Step 2: Define the Email Strategy



**For each email sequence, identify:**



1. **Market Segment:** Which subset of their potential customers?

   - Example: "Series B SaaS companies" vs. "Enterprise finance teams"



2. **Persona:** Who specifically are you writing to?

   - Example: "VP of Sales" vs. "RevOps Manager" vs. "CEO"



3. **Pain Point:** What specific problem does this persona have?

   - Must be concrete, not generic

   - Should be something they actively feel

   - Must be something your product/service solves



4. **Angle:** Your unique take on solving this pain

   - Why your approach is different

   - Why it matters now

   - What makes it credible



**Note:** Create separate sequences for different combinations. Don't try to be everything to everyone in one email.



### Step 3: Write the Opening Email



**Structure (combining "Tell The Full Story" + 13 Rules + Buyer Psychology):**



1. **Subject Line**

   - Short (3-7 words)

   - **Rule 1 (Relevance):** Specific to their situation

   - **Rule 2 (Curiosity):** Create intrigue

   - **Rule 10 (Pattern Interrupt):** Stand out

   - Examples: "Your Q1 forecast", "Series B pipeline question", "Found something in your data"



2. **Opening Line (Hook)**

   - **Addresses: "Who are you? Can I trust you?"**

   - Establish credibility immediately (Rule 3 - Social Proof)

   - **Addresses: "Is this relevant to me?"**

   - Front-load personalization (Rule 1 - Relevance)

   - Examples: "I work with 8 Series B fintech companies, including Treasury Hub..."



3. **Context (Their Pain/Situation)**

   - **Rule 4 (Authority):** Articulate their pain better than they can

   - Make it specific to their segment/persona

   - **Addresses skepticism:** Show you understand their world

   - 2-3 sentences max, crystal clear (Rule 7)



4. **Your Solution (The "angle")**

   - How you solve this specific problem

   - Why your approach is different

   - What makes it credible (proof point, case study)

   - **Rule 3 (Social Proof):** Reference real results

   - **Addresses trust paradox:** Value-focused, not sales-y



5. **Optional: Value-First Offer**

   - **Rule 6 (Reciprocity):** Give something free

   - Lead magnet, framework, analysis

   - "No strings attached"



6. **Clear CTA**

   - **Rule 11 (Simplicity):** Effortless, low-friction

   - **Rule 13 (Autonomy):** Let them choose

   - **Addresses: "What's the effort/risk?"**

   - Examples: "Worth a quick call?" / "Want me to send the framework?"

   - Always include easy out: "No pressure if timing isn't right"



**Email length:** 75-150 words ideal. Must "tell the whole story" but be concise.



**Tone:** Professional but conversational. Human, not sales-y (**Trust Paradox**).



Avoid:

- Overly formal language ("I hope this finds you well")

- Hype or exaggeration (triggers skepticism)

- Generic templates (violates Rule 1 - Relevance)

- Pushy language (violates Rule 13 - Autonomy)



### Step 4: Write the Bump/Follow-up Email



**Sent 3-4 days after opening email if no response**



**CRITICAL: Apply Sequence Momentum principle - each email must add NEW value**



**Structure:**



1. **Subject Line:** RE: [original subject]



2. **Opening:**

   - **ADD NEW VALUE** (not "just following up")

   - New angle, new proof point, new insight

   - Examples:

     - "Quick addition: just published case study..."

     - "Different angle on my email from last week..."

     - "Talked to [similar persona] yesterday about this..."



3. **Body:**

   - **NEW information:** Case study, insight, data point, perspective

   - **DIFFERENT social proof:** Not same company as opener

   - **FRESH angle:** Related but different pain point or opportunity

   - Or: Simpler, more direct version



4. **CTA:**

   - **DIFFERENT than opener:** Vary the ask

   - Email 1: "Worth a call?"

   - Email 2: "Want me to send the framework?"

   - Email 3: "Is this a priority, or should I check back later?"



**Bump length:** 50-100 words. Shorter than opener.



**Avoid phrases like:**

- ❌ "Just following up"

- ❌ "Bumping to top of inbox"

- ❌ "Checking in"

- ❌ "In case you missed"

✅ Add new value instead



### Step 5: Generate Variations



Create 2-3 variations of the sequence for testing:



**Variation A:** Problem-focused

- Lead with the pain/challenge

- Heavy on empathy



**Variation B:** Solution-focused

- Lead with your differentiation

- Heavy on unique approach



**Variation C:** Social proof-focused

- Lead with results/customers

- Heavy on credibility



## Quality Checks



Before finalizing emails, verify:



### Framework Checks:

- [ ] **Specific:** Could this email be sent to 100 other companies? (If yes, it's too generic)

- [ ] **Complete:** Does the email tell the full story? (Could it stand alone?)

- [ ] **One angle:** Is it focused on ONE persona + pain combination?

- [ ] **Clear value:** Within 10 seconds, can they understand why this matters to them?

- [ ] **Low friction:** Is the CTA simple and clear?

- [ ] **No hype:** Have you avoided exaggeration and buzzwords?

- [ ] **Proof:** Is there credibility/social proof?



### Psychology Checks (13 Rules + Buyer Brain):

- [ ] **Rule 1 - Relevance:** Does it immediately feel "this is about ME"?

- [ ] **Rule 2 - Curiosity:** Does it create intrigue without being too mysterious?

- [ ] **Rule 3 - Social Proof:** Have you established credibility?

- [ ] **Rule 4 - Authority:** Can you articulate their pain better than they can?

- [ ] **Rule 7 - Clarity:** Is it crystal clear and scannable?

- [ ] **Rule 10 - Pattern Interrupt:** Does it stand out from typical cold emails?

- [ ] **Rule 11 - Simplicity:** Is the CTA effortless?

- [ ] **Rule 13 - Autonomy:** Does it let them feel in control?

- [ ] **Skepticism addressed:** Credibility established early?

- [ ] **Attention grabbed:** Pattern interrupt in first 3 seconds?

- [ ] **Trust built:** Tone human, not salesy?

- [ ] **4 Questions answered:** Trust? Relevant? Effort? Risk?



### Tactical Checks (MMF + Sequences + Language):

- [ ] **Avoid generic openers:** No "Hope you're well" or "Just checking in"

- [ ] **Avoid overused adjectives:** No "innovative", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary"

- [ ] **Avoid tired jargon:** No "leverage", "synergy", "touch base"

- [ ] **Avoid cliché social proof:** Name specific companies, not "Fortune 500"

- [ ] **Avoid pushy language:** No "limited time offer" or "act now"

- [ ] **Avoid vague claims:** No "10x results" - use specific numbers

- [ ] **Sequence momentum:** Does each follow-up add NEW value?

- [ ] **MMF consideration:** Is this template fresh or overused?



## Output Format



For each sequence, provide:



```

## Sequence [#]: [Segment] - [Persona] - [Pain Point]



**Target:** [Description of who this is for]

**Angle:** [Your unique take/approach]



### Email 1: Opening



**Subject:** [Subject line]



**Body:**

[Email content]



**Notes:** [Why this approach, what to customize]



---



### Email 2: Bump (Send 3-4 days later)



**Subject:** RE: [original subject]



**Body:**

[Bump content]



**Notes:** [What to adjust based on response]

```

## When to Use This Skill



Use this skill when:

- Creating cold email campaigns

- Building outreach sequences for new ICP

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid



1. **Too generic:** Email could be sent to anyone

2. **Too many angles:** Trying to solve multiple pains in one email

3. **Too long:** Can't tell the story in 150 words? Email is unfocused

4. **No proof:** Claims without credibility

5. **Weak CTA:** Unclear what you want them to do

6. **Bad targeting:** Wrong persona for the pain point



## Integration with Other Skills



Works well with:

- **extract-insights** - Pull pain points from discovery calls to inform emails

- **refine-positioning** - Use positioning insights to craft angles

- **linkedin-growth-strategy** - Coordinate cold email with LinkedIn outreach



## Notes for Improvement



Tell user if:

- Generated emails feel too generic

- Need more industry-specific angles

- Framework doesn't fit your business model

- Bump emails aren't adding value
