# Cold Email Templates & Examples

## Template Structure

### Opening Email Template

```
Subject: [3-7 words, specific to their pain]

Hi [First Name],

[Personalized hook - company specific observation, recent event, or relevant context]

[Context: 2-3 sentences explaining the pain/challenge they likely face as a [persona] at a [segment] company]

[Your solution/angle: How you solve this specifically, what makes your approach different]

[Proof: Brief social proof, example, or credibility marker]

[CTA: Simple, clear ask - usually "Worth a quick call?" or similar]

[Your name]
```

## Real Examples by Format

### Example 1: Problem-First Approach
**Target:** VP Sales at Series B SaaS companies
**Pain:** Pipeline forecasting is manual and board doesn't trust the numbers

```
Subject: Your Q1 forecast confidence

Hi Sarah,

I noticed Acme just closed Series B with Sequoia (congrats!).

Most Series B VP Sales I talk to have the same challenge right now: Finance wants weekly pipeline updates, the board wants forecast accuracy, but you're still pulling from 3 spreadsheets and guessing at close dates.

We built a RevOps + FP&A solution specifically for this phase. Instead of a CRM analyst, you get board-ready analytics that updates automatically - same data Finance sees. Helped Treasury Hub reduce forecast error from 35% to 12% in their first quarter.

Worth a quick call to see if this would help Acme?

### Example 2: Solution-First Approach
**Target:** RevOps Manager at PE-backed companies
**Pain:** Portfolio company needs to standardize GTM quickly

```
Subject: PE portfolio RevOps playbook

Hi Marcus,

Saw EigenRev just added Acme to the portfolio.

We've worked with 8 PE-backed companies in the first 100 days post-acquisition. The common thread: They need RevOps infrastructure fast, but hiring a full team takes 6 months and $500K.

Our approach: Install the complete stack (CRM, automation, analytics) in 30 days, train your team, then hand it off. Think fractional RevOps team that builds your foundation then exits.

Just finished this with Voice Brain (another EigenRev company). Happy to share what we built.

15 minutes next week to walk through the playbook?

### Example 3: Social Proof-First Approach
**Target:** Founder at 15-50 person services business
**Pain:** Still using cold calls and spreadsheets, needs modern GTM

```
Subject: Legacy services → modern GTM

Hi Jennifer,

I just helped a $20M consulting firm replace their cold-calling SDRs with a Clay + AI workflow. Same number of meetings, 70% lower cost.

Most founder-led services businesses are 10 years behind on GTM - not because they don't care, but because "modern RevOps" is built for SaaS, not services.

We translated the playbook: LinkedIn + intent data + automated sequencing, but adapted for services sales cycles and relationship-driven closing.

Their CEO told me last week: "I should have done this 3 years ago."

Worth exploring for Acme?

## Bump Email Templates

### Bump 1: Additional Value Add

```
Subject: RE: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from last week about [pain point].

Quick addition: Just published a breakdown of how [similar company] rebuilt their [relevant area] in 30 days. Thought you might find it useful even if you're not ready to chat.

[Link or offer to send]

Still worth 15 minutes to explore for [Company]?

[Your name]
```

### Bump 2: Simpler/More Direct

```
Subject: RE: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

I know you're busy - real quick question:

Is [pain point] something you're actively working on right now, or should I check back in a few months?

Either way is totally fine - just want to make sure I'm not filling your inbox unnecessarily.

[Your name]
```

### Bump 3: Different Angle

```
Subject: RE: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

Different angle on my email from last week:

[New pain point or perspective on the same challenge]

[Brief example or insight]

Worth a call, or should I step back?

[Your name]
```

## Email Length Guidelines

**Opening Email:**
- Minimum: 75 words
- Sweet spot: 100-125 words
- Maximum: 150 words

**Bump Email:**
- Minimum: 40 words
- Sweet spot: 60-80 words
- Maximum: 100 words

**Why these lengths:**
- Long enough to tell the full story
- Short enough to read in 30 seconds
- Forces you to be specific and focused

## Personalization Levels

### Level 1: Basic (Required)
- First name
- Company name
- Title/role

### Level 2: Solid (Recommended)
- Recent event (funding, hire, launch)
- Specific challenge for their segment
- Relevant proof point

### Level 3: Deep (High-value targets)
- Detailed company research
- Persona-specific pain observation
- Custom angle tailored to their situation
- Highly relevant social proof

## Tone Guidelines

**Do:**
- Professional but conversational
- Confident but not cocky
- Helpful but not pushy
- Specific and concrete

**Don't:**
- Overly formal ("I hope this correspondence finds you well...")
- Hype-filled ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "10x your...")
- Desperate ("Can I have 5 minutes of your time?")
- Generic ("We help companies grow faster...")

## Common Opening Lines That Work

1. **Recent event:** "I noticed [Company] just [raised Series B / hired VP Sales / launched new product]..."

2. **Peer reference:** "I was talking to [similar role] at [similar company] and they mentioned..."

3. **Observation:** "Saw your post on LinkedIn about [relevant topic]..."

4. **Pattern:** "Most [persona] at [segment] companies I talk to face..."

5. **Timing:** "Now that [Company] is [stage/milestone], you're probably dealing with..."

## Common Opening Lines to Avoid

1. "I hope this email finds you well" (generic, outdated)
2. "Can I have 5 minutes of your time?" (leads with ask)
3. "We're the leading provider of..." (about you, not them)
4. "I've been trying to reach you..." (desperate, pushy)
5. "I have a revolutionary solution..." (hype, unbelievable)

## CTA Variations

**Exploratory:**
- "Worth a quick call?"
- "15 minutes next week to explore?"
- "Would this be useful for [Company]?"

**Value-First:**
- "Want me to send over the framework?"
- "I can walk you through how [similar company] did this - interested?"
- "Happy to share the playbook - worth 15 minutes?"

**Permission-Based:**
- "Is this something you're actively working on?"
- "Wrong timing, or worth a conversation?"
- "Should I follow up in a few months, or explore now?"

**Direct:**
- "Let's chat?"
- "Quick call this week?"
- "15 minutes to discuss?"

## Formatting Best Practices

**Paragraphs:**
- 1-3 sentences per paragraph
- Blank line between paragraphs
- Use white space liberally

**Bold/Italics:**
- Sparingly, if at all
- Only to emphasize key point
- Never in CTA

**Links:**
- Only if adding value (case study, resource)
- Not to your homepage (unless they asked)
- Track clicks if possible

## Testing Strategy

Create 2-3 variations of each sequence:

**What to test:**
- Problem-first vs. solution-first
- Short (75 words) vs. medium (125 words)
- Different social proof
- Different CTAs
- Different subject lines

**Sample size:**
- Minimum 50 sends per variation
- 100+ for statistical significance

**What to measure:**
- Open rate (subject line test)
- Reply rate (email body test)
- Positive reply rate (quality test)
- Meeting booked rate (conversion test)
