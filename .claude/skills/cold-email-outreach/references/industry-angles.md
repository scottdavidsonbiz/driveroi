   - Efficiency, growth, compliance, speed, cost?

2. **What's their buying style?**
   - Data-driven, relationship-driven, risk-averse, innovative?

3. **What's their timing?**
   - Urgent need or exploring?

4. **What's their context?**
   - Growing, struggling, transitioning, stable?

5. **What proof do they need?**
   - Companies like them, metrics, case studies, demos?

Match your angle to these answers.
