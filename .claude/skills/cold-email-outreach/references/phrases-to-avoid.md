# 76 Phrases to Avoid in Cold Emails

These phrases trigger spam filters, cause eye-rolls, or scream "generic sales email". Avoid them to stand out and build trust.

## Generic Openers (Avoid These - They're Overused)

These opening lines instantly signal "mass email" and kill engagement:

1. Hope you're well
2. Hope this finds you well
3. Just checking in
4. I trust this email finds you
5. Hope you're having a great week
6. I wanted to reach out
7. I noticed that
8. I saw that

### Why they're bad:
- Everyone uses them
- Add no value
- Show zero personalization
- Trigger "delete" reflex

### What to do instead:
- **Jump straight to relevance:** "Saw you just raised Series B"
- **Ask a question:** "Quick question about your pipeline forecasting"
- **Make an observation:** "Three companies in your space just solved this problem"
- **Be direct:** "I'm going to be direct: your forecast is probably off by 20%"

## Overused Adjectives (Sound Like Every Other Sales Email)

These buzzwords have lost all meaning through overuse:

1. Impressive
2. Innovative
3. Cutting-edge
4. Industry-leading
5. Best-in-class
6. World-class

8. Game-changing
9. Next-generation
10. Robust

## Overused Trigger Phrases (Everyone Uses These)

These personalization attempts are so common they're now red flags:

67. Saw you're hiring
68. Noticed your recent funding
69. Congratulations on the growth
70. Saw your LinkedIn post
71. Love what you're doing with

### Why they're problematic:
- Used in every cold email
- Buyers see them constantly
- Lost their impact
- Can feel insincere

### What to do instead:
- **Use them BUT add specificity:** 
  - ❌ "Saw you're hiring"
  - ✅ "Saw you're hiring 5 SDRs next month - here's the onboarding mistake most Series B companies make"

- **Go deeper:**
  - ❌ "Noticed your recent funding"
  - ✅ "You just raised Series B with Sequoia - this is exactly the phase where forecast accuracy becomes make-or-break"

- **Make it relevant:**
  - ❌ "Saw your LinkedIn post"
  - ✅ "Your post on LinkedIn about modern RevOps - that's exactly the approach working for Series B companies right now"

**The key:** Don't just mention it - connect it to value/relevance.

## Meeting Requests (Sound Too Formal/Demanding)

These CTA phrases feel heavy and formal:

72. Jump on a quick call
73. Grab 15 minutes
74. Brief chat
75. Quick sync
76. Hop on a call

### Why they're problematic:
- Overused
- "Quick call" is never quick
- Feel salesy
- Violate simplicity principle

### What to do instead:
- **Simpler:** "Worth a call?"
- **Lower friction:** "Want me to send the framework first?"
- **Give options:** "Quick call worth it, or should I just send the case study?"
- **Their choice:** "Is this worth exploring?"

**Examples:**

❌ "Can we jump on a quick call to discuss synergies?"
✅ "Worth a quick call?"

❌ "Let's grab 15 minutes for a brief chat to sync"
✅ "15 minutes next week to explore?"

❌ "Would love to hop on a quick sync to touch base"
✅ "Should we chat, or wrong timing?"

## The Exception: Strategic Use

**Sometimes you CAN use these phrases if:**

1. **You're being ironic/self-aware:**
   ```
   "I know everyone says 'hope this finds you well' - 
   I'm going to skip that and get straight to it:"
   ```

2. **You're pattern interrupting:**
   ```
   "This will sound like every other cold email, but hear me out:"
   ```

3. **You're testing deliberately:**
   - Track if a "forbidden phrase" works for YOUR audience
   - Data > rules

**But generally:** Just avoid them. There are better ways to communicate.
