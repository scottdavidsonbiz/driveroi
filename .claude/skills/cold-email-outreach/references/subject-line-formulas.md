## A/B Testing Subject Lines

### Test Structure

**Keep constant:**
- Email body
- Send time
- Target list

**Change only:**
- Subject line

**Sample test:**
- **Variation A:** "Your Q1 forecast confidence"
- **Variation B:** "Series B pipeline forecasting"
- **Variation C:** "Board-ready revenue analytics"

**What to measure:**
- Open rate (primary metric)
- Reply rate (secondary - confirms relevance)

### When to Test

**Test when:**
- Launching new campaign (test 2-3 variations)
- Open rate < 40% (something's wrong)
- Entering new segment (unknown what resonates)

**Don't test when:**
- Sample size < 50 per variation
- Too many variables changing at once
- You haven't tested email body quality first

## Subject Line by Industry

## Subject Line Red Flags

**Spam triggers to avoid:**
- ALL CAPS
- Multiple exclamation points!!!
- Excessive punctuation...?!
- $$$, %, FREE, URGENT
- Fake "Re:" or "Fwd:"
- Emojis (in B2B context)
- Brackets like [URGENT]

**Too generic:**
- "Touching base"
- "Following up"
- "Quick question"
- "Partnership opportunity"
- "Thought you'd be interested"

**Too salesy:**
- "How we can help [Company]"
- "Increase revenue by 300%"
- "Revolutionary solution"
- "You need to see this"

## Length Guidelines

**Character count:**
- Minimum: 15 characters ("Series B RevOps" = 16)
- Sweet spot: 30-40 characters
- Maximum: 50 characters

**Why?**
- Mobile email clients truncate around 30-40 chars
- Shorter = more impact
- Forces specificity

**Test your subject lines:**
- Send yourself a test
- Check on mobile device
- Does it truncate? If yes, shorten.

## Personalization in Subject Lines

**Use sparingly:**

**Good uses:**
- Company name: "Acme's RevOps question"
- Timing: "Post-Series B setup"
- Shared connection: "From [mutual contact]"

**Bad uses:**
- First name: "Sarah - read this!" (feels spammy)
- Job title: "For VP Sales" (obvious automation)
- Generic personalization: "{{First_Name}}, this will help!" (cringe)

**Rule:** If you personalize, make it natural and relevant, not just showing off you have their data.

## Geographic/Industry Modifiers

**Use when relevant:**

**Examples:**
- "UK SaaS RevOps"
- "B2B fintech question"
- "Enterprise sales approach"
- "SMB automation playbook"

**When to use:**
- Geography matters (regulations, norms)
- Industry is highly specialized
- Size/segment changes approach

**When NOT to use:**
- If it makes subject line too long
- If it doesn't add relevance
- If it's obvious from email body
