# 3 Tactical Concepts for Cold Email Success

Less about psychology, more about strategy and execution.

## 1. Message Market Fit (MMF)

**Concept:** The process of identifying the message that best resonates with your specific market/audience.

### The Process:

**Start:** Test a multitude of templates and gradually hone in on the golden goose.

**Continue:** Even when you achieve MMF, never stop testing different angles. Periodically tweak the most effective message.

### Two Critical Reasons:

#### A) Avoid getting marked as spam

**The spam filter hates repetition.**

If you send the same exact message repeatedly, spam filters will catch it and your deliverability tanks.

**How to avoid:**
- Rotate templates
- Vary your phrasing
- Test different hooks
- Change up examples/proof points
- Adjust CTAs

#### B) Mitigate copy fatigue

**Buyers are drowning in outreach.**

Once a message becomes overused in the market, buyers become desensitized to it. They've seen it 50 times already.

**How to avoid:**
- Keep testing new approaches
- Retire templates that stop working
- Monitor response rates closely
- Refresh messaging quarterly
- Watch what competitors are sending

### MMF Implementation:

**Month 1:**
- Create 5-10 template variations
- Test across segments
- Track response rates meticulously

**Month 2-3:**
- Identify top 2-3 performers
- Double down on winners
- Retire losers
- Create variations of winners

**Ongoing:**
- Refresh templates quarterly
- Test new angles monthly
- Watch for declining performance
- Stay ahead of copy fatigue

### Example MMF Evolution:

**Template A (Month 1):** Problem-first approach
- Response rate: 3.2%
- Keep testing

**Template B (Month 1):** Social proof-first
- Response rate: 1.8%
- Retire

**Template C (Month 1):** Story-based
- Response rate: 5.1%
- **WINNER - Scale this**

**Template C2 (Month 2):** Story variation
- Response rate: 4.8%
- Good backup

**Template C3 (Month 3):** Another story angle
- Response rate: 4.2%
- Rotate these 3 story approaches

**By Month 4:** Original Template C response drops to 3.5%
- Time to refresh - audience has copy fatigue
- Test new story angles or switch to different format

## 2. Sequence Momentum

**Concept:** Gone are the days of "just checking in" or "bumping to the top of the inbox". Each message should build on the last, creating a compelling narrative that grows stronger over time.

### The Core Principle:

Every follow-up needs to inject:
- **New value**
- **Fresh angles/CTAs**
- **Different social proof**

The compound effect is real: where multiple thoughtful messages create enough weight to convert, even if individual messages only land a moderate punch.

### Building Sequence Momentum:

**Email 1 (Opening):**
- Tell the full story
- Establish credibility
- Create curiosity
- Clear CTA

**Email 2 (3-4 days later):**
- NEW angle on same problem
- DIFFERENT social proof
- ADDITIONAL value (case study, framework, insight)
- Simpler/different CTA

**Email 3 (3-4 days later):**
- ANOTHER perspective
- NEW proof point
- Maybe: story/narrative approach
- Give them easy out (autonomy)

**Email 4 (Optional, 5-7 days later):**
- Assume they're not interested BUT
- One last value-add
- "Closing the loop" tone
- Clear exit

### Bad Sequence (No Momentum):

```
Email 1: [Good opening email]
Email 2: "Just following up on my email from last week"
Email 3: "Bumping this to the top of your inbox"
Email 4: "Last try before I close your file"
```

**Problem:** No new value. Just reminders. Annoying.

### Good Sequence (Building Momentum):

```
Email 1: Problem-first approach with social proof
Email 2: "Quick addition - just published case study on how [Company] 
         solved this exact problem. Thought you might find it useful 
         even if not ready to chat. Want me to send?"
Email 3: "Different angle: talked to [similar persona] at [similar 
         company] yesterday about this exact challenge. They mentioned 
         [specific insight]. Does this resonate with what you're seeing?"
Email 4: "Last email - I know you're busy. If this isn't a priority 
         right now, totally understand. Should I check back in Q2?"
```

**Why it works:** Each email adds value. Each email can stand alone. Together, they build case.

### Sequence Momentum Tactics:

**Vary your social proof:**
- Email 1: Company A case study
- Email 2: Company B different result
- Email 3: Industry award or trend data
- Email 4: Personal story or anecdote

**Vary your angles:**
- Email 1: Pain point X
- Email 2: Related pain point Y
- Email 3: Opportunity/upside angle
- Email 4: Risk of inaction

**Vary your CTAs:**
- Email 1: "Worth a quick call?"
- Email 2: "Want me to send the framework?"
- Email 3: "Quick question - is [pain] something you're actively working on?"
- Email 4: "Should I check back later, or close your file?"

**Vary your format:**
- Email 1: Standard structure
- Email 2: Shorter, more direct
- Email 3: Story-based
- Email 4: Personal/conversational

### Measuring Momentum:

**Good signs:**
- Response rate increases with later emails
- People say "sorry I missed your earlier emails"
- They reference multiple emails in response
- Higher quality conversations (they're warmed up)

**Bad signs:**
- Response rate drops with each email
- Unsubscribes increase
- Responses are annoyed/defensive
- You're basically spamming

## 3. Forget The Rules

**Concept:** Sales gurus love to preach hard rules: Keep it under 50 words. One CTA only. Never use P.S. No long message. But the reality is, some of the highest-performing cold messages break these principles outright.

**The truth:** They don't follow "best practices" - they break them, strategically.

### Examples of Effective Rule-Breaking:

#### A) Double the case studies, double the credibility

**Traditional rule:** One proof point only. Keep it focused.

**Strategic break:** 
```
"We just helped Treasury Hub reduce forecast error from 35% to 12%. 
And last month, BankOS used the same approach to cut their board prep 
time from 3 days to 4 hours."
```

**Why it works:** One proof point in the body establishes credibility. Another in the P.S. reinforces impact without feeling repetitive. Repetition reinforces, when done right.

#### B) Longer messages, if justified, convert

**Traditional rule:** Keep it under 100 words.

**Strategic break:** If the message is valuable and your prospect reads it, length doesn't matter. Prospects read if you make it worth their time.

**Example:** 200-word email that tells compelling story, shows deep understanding, provides genuine insight.

**Key:** Must be:
- Worth reading (compelling)
- Well-structured (scannable)
- Valuable (not fluff)

#### C) WhatsApp-style messages work in DMs

**Traditional rule:** Professional, polished, corporate speak.

**Strategic break:** Short, punchy, low-friction copy can drive replies better than polished corporate speak.

**Example:**
```
Hey Sarah -

Quick question.

Is pipeline forecasting something you're actively working on right now?

We just built something for Treasury Hub that might be relevant.

5 min call worth it?

- Scott
```

**Why it works:** Feels human. Low barrier. Pattern interrupt. (Obviously) Forget formalities.

#### D) CTA stacking can work

**Traditional rule:** One CTA only.

**Strategic break:** Light ask in body ("Am I even barking up the right tree?"), softer nudge in P.S. ("If timing's off, I can send a case study instead.")

**Example:**
```
Body: ...Worth exploring for Acme?

P.S. If timing's not right for a call, I can send over a case study 
of how we did this with Treasury Hub. Some people find that helpful 
even if they're not ready to chat.
```

**Why it works:** Gives them options. Multiple ways to engage. Some ignore main CTA but bite on P.S.

### When to Break Rules:

**Break rules when:**
- You have a good reason
- You're testing deliberately
- You understand WHY the rule exists
- You're being strategic, not lazy

**Don't break rules when:**
- You're just being verbose
- You're showing off
- You're not testing/tracking
- You don't understand the principle

### The Meta-Rule:

**"Ditch the rigid rules and frameworks and start breaking patterns."**

**What this means:**
- Test everything
- Break conventions deliberately
- Track what works FOR YOUR AUDIENCE
- Be willing to ignore "best practices"
- Trust your data over guru advice

### Strategic Rule-Breaking Checklist:

Before breaking a "rule", ask:

- [ ] Do I understand WHY the rule exists?
- [ ] Do I have a strategic reason to break it?
- [ ] Am I testing this deliberately?
- [ ] Will I track the results?
- [ ] Does this serve the prospect or just me?

### Examples from Experience:

**"Double the case studies" worked because:**
- Reinforcement without repetition
- Different proof points appeal to different concerns
- P.S. feels like bonus, not sales pitch

**"Longer messages" worked when:**
- Telling genuine story (not fluff)
- Providing real insight (not pitch)
- Well-structured and scannable
- Worth the prospect's time

**"WhatsApp-style" worked for:**
- Busy executives who hate formality
- Second/third touch points (warmer)
- LinkedIn DMs (not first email)
- Younger buyer personas

**"CTA stacking" worked when:**
- Primary CTA was call
- Secondary CTA was resource (lower friction)
- Gave them options without confusing
- P.S. felt natural, not pushy

## MMF + Sequence Momentum + Rule Breaking

**Email 1:** [Tested template that achieved MMF]
**Email 2:** [Builds momentum with new angle] + [Breaks "one CTA" rule]
**Email 3:** [Different template variation to avoid copy fatigue] + [Breaks "keep it short" rule with valuable story]
**Email 4:** [Breaks "no checking in" rule but does it strategically]

This combination:
- Avoids spam filters (variation)
- Prevents copy fatigue (rotation)
- Builds momentum (each adds value)
- Breaks patterns (strategically breaking rules)

**Result:** Higher response rates, better conversations, more meetings.
