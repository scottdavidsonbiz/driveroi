# 13 Rules of Engagement

These psychological principles make cold emails more effective. Apply strategically based on your audience and goal.

## 1. Relevance: "this is about ME"

**Principle:** Your prospect should instantly think "this message was crafted specifically for me".

**How to apply:**
- Weave in specific details: role, time in role, industry, company, colleagues, product, pain points, goals, tech stack, recent wins
- Front-load personalizations into opening statement to establish relevance immediately
- Optimize the preview text (first line visible in inbox)

**Example:**
❌ "I help companies grow faster"
✅ "Saw you just hired 3 SDRs at Acme - here's how Series B SaaS teams avoid the common onboarding mistakes"

---

## 2. Curiosity: the power of mystery

**Principle:** Humans are hardwired to hate information gaps (Zeigarnik effect). Creating uncertainty compels people to resolve it.

**How to apply:**
- Find the sweet spot: drop enough breadcrumbs to create intrigue while clearly positioning your solution
- Don't reveal everything - make them want to learn more
- Avoid being too mysterious (becomes annoying)

**Example:**
❌ "We have a solution for you"
✅ "We found something in your pipeline data that most Series B companies miss - it's costing you about 15% of forecasted revenue"

---

## 3. Social Proof: show you're legit

**Principle:** Cold outreach automatically triggers skepticism. Build credibility immediately.

**Right way:**
- Reference case studies with competitors, companies in adjacent spaces, or recognizable companies
- At minimum, mention a company they'd recognize

**Wrong way:**
- Reference irrelevant or unknown companies
- No social proof at all (forced to rely on pure pitch)

**If you have no relevant case studies:**
- Show empathy by acknowledging lack of relevance
- Add credible overlap: "We recently started with Owash - not exactly laundry but still a vibrant startup just like yours"
- Convey social proof through awards or certifications (subtle, P.S. statement style)

**Example:**
✅ "We just helped Treasury Hub (another fintech in your space) reduce forecast error from 35% to 12%"
✅ "P.S. We were recognized by Gartner as a Cool Vendor in RevOps for 2024"

---

## 4. Authority bias: flex your expertise

**Principle:** If you can articulate your prospects' pain better than they can, they'll automatically assume you have the solution.

**Best sales advice:** Get specific around buyers' challenges & your industry insights.

**How to apply:**
- Demonstrate deep understanding of their specific situation
- Show you've seen this pattern before
- Speak their language (use their terminology)

**Important:** This does NOT conflict with Rule 13 (autonomy bias). Demonstrate expertise while empowering the buyer through tone.

**Example:**
❌ "We help with sales problems"
✅ "Most Series B companies face this: Finance wants weekly updates, the board wants forecast accuracy, but you're pulling from 3 spreadsheets and guessing at close dates"

---

## 5. FOMO/Loss aversion: the fear factor

**Principle:** Humans value potential losses more than equivalent gains (powerful psychological trigger).

**How to apply in cold outreach:**
- Create urgency WITHOUT seeming desperate or spammy
- Hint at opportunities others (ideally competitors) are already seizing
- Subtlety is key - avoid "offer expires at end of month"

**Example:**
❌ "Limited time offer!"
✅ "Three of your competitors just implemented this in Q4 - early movers are seeing 20% better forecast accuracy"

---

## 6. Reciprocity: give first

**Principle:** "You scratch my back, I scratch yours." People feel compelled to respond when you've created value first.

**How to apply:**
- Personalize message demonstrating effort
- Show you've done homework
- Offer valuable resource (lead magnet) for free
- Make it no-strings-attached

**Example:**
✅ "I put together a quick analysis of your LinkedIn presence vs. 3 competitors - want me to send it over? No strings attached, figured it might be useful"
✅ "Noticed you're hiring 5 SDRs - I have a 30-day onboarding checklist we use with Series B companies. Want me to send it?"

---

## 7. Clarity: crystal clear comms

**Principle:** "Confuse, you lose." - Sales mentor wisdom

**The hard truth:** If you fill your message with fancy words and jargon, you'll lose engagement. Feature-talk and technical terms spell disengagement.

**How to apply:**
- Keep message simple and scannable
- Short sentences
- Clear value proposition
- No buzzwords or hype

**Example:**
❌ "Our revolutionary platform leverages cutting-edge AI to synergize your go-to-market efforts and optimize conversion"
✅ "We help Series B companies forecast revenue accurately enough that CFOs stop questioning the numbers"

---

## 8. Urgency: time factor

**Principle:** Tie urgency to real business impact/market movements.

**How to apply:**
- Leverage time-sensitive triggers from Personalization section:
  - Active job roles
  - Fundraising rounds
  - Company milestones
  - Market timing
- Build narrative around compelling events
- Create REAL urgency (not fake scarcity)

**Example:**
❌ "This offer ends Friday"
✅ "You just raised Series B - the first 90 days are critical for setting up board reporting. After that, you're stuck with whatever you built in a rush"

---

## 9. Ego: make them the hero

**Principle:** From Dale Carnegie: "Make people feel important." It's a fundamental biological truth - everyone wants to look good, seem smart, be ahead of the curve.

**Two ways to do this:**

**A) Subtle flattery:**
- Drive positive sentiment
- Ensure compliment is relevant to your pitch
- Avoid overdoing it (feels disingenuous)
- Keep tone neutral and natural-sounding

**Example:**
✅ "Saw your post on LinkedIn about modern RevOps - that's exactly the approach that's working for Series B companies right now"

**B) Creative storytelling:**
- Instead of flattery, use humor and narrative
- Paint picture where they're the undisputed leader
- Elevate them in creative, playful, memorable way

**Example:**
✅ "While your competitors are still manually pulling pipeline reports, you'll be the VP who walks into board meetings with real-time forecasts that actually match reality"

---

## 10. Pattern Interrupt: be different

**Principle:** Major theme. Human brain is hardwired to ignore predictable and familiar patterns.

**The reality:** Buyers see 1000s of messages every week. The tone, format, offer - it all needs to be different.

**How to apply:**
- Don't sound like every other cold email
- Different hook approach
- Unexpected format
- Unique angle or perspective
- Break the expected pattern

**Example:**
❌ "I hope this email finds you well..."
✅ "I'm going to be direct: your pipeline forecast is probably off by 20-30%. Not your fault - it's just how Series B companies operate without the right infrastructure"

---

## 11. Simplicity Bias: easy does it

**Principle:** While Rule 7 is about being clear, this is about keeping it SIMPLE. Specifically in the CTA.

**Key insight:** The easier something seems, the more likely people are to engage.

**How to apply:**
- CTA should be effortless
- Low friction, low commitment
- Make the next step obvious and easy

**Example:**
❌ "Can we schedule a 30-minute discovery call where I walk you through our 14-step process?"
✅ "Worth a quick call?"
✅ "Want me to send the framework?"

---

## 12. Narrative Transportation Bias: story time

**Principle:** When information comes wrapped in a story, barriers drop. People become more receptive. Stories make sense. The best salespeople are storytellers. Stories are emotive & engaging.

**The problem:** In outreach, we strip all life from our pitch. We follow tired formulas with zero emotional impact.

**How to apply:**
- Well-crafted narrative running throughout your sequence
- Not only stands out but builds immediate connection
- Use storytelling template for structure

**Example:**
❌ "We provide RevOps services"
✅ "I just watched a $20M consulting firm close deals with cold calls and spreadsheets. Their new VP Sales couldn't believe they didn't have a CRM. Six months later, they had the full stack and 3x'd their pipeline"

---

## 13. Autonomy Bias: let them choose

**Principle:** Humans love having control over their destiny. The moment someone feels forced into something (especially from someone they don't know), resistance kicks in.

**How to apply:**
- Be mindful of tone and language
- Give them agency
- Make it feel like THEIR choice
- Avoid pushy, desperate language
- Offer options or easy out

**Example:**
❌ "I'll follow up next week if I don't hear back"
✅ "Is this something you're actively working on, or should I check back in a few months?"
✅ "Worth exploring, or wrong timing?"

---

## Applying Multiple Rules

**Best practice:** Layer multiple rules in one email

**Example combining rules:**

```
Subject: Your Q1 forecast [RELEVANCE]

Hi Sarah,

I just analyzed pipeline forecasts from 12 Series B SaaS companies. [AUTHORITY]

Found something interesting: the ones with CFO-trusted forecasts all did 
one thing differently. [CURIOSITY + SOCIAL PROOF]

You just closed Series B with Sequoia (congrats!) - this is exactly the 
phase where forecast accuracy becomes make-or-break. Three companies in 
your space implemented this in Q4, and they're already seeing 30% better 
board meetings. [URGENCY + FOMO]

I put together a quick breakdown of what they did. Want me to send it? 
[RECIPROCITY + SIMPLICITY]

No pressure if timing isn't right - just thought it might be useful as 
you're scaling the team. [AUTONOMY]

Scott
```
