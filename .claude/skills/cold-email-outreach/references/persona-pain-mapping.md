## Pain Point Validation Questions

Before using a pain point in an email, ask:

2. **Is it acute?** Are they feeling this pain RIGHT NOW?
3. **Do they know they have it?** Or do you need to educate them first?
4. **Can you solve it?** Don't highlight pains you can't address
5. **Is it a priority?** Nice-to-fix or must-fix-now?
