## 🚀 Unique Value Propositions (What They Can't Get Elsewhere)

### 1. Build → Run → Prove → Handoff Model
**Standard consultant:** "Here's your strategy doc. Good luck!"  
**Us:** "We build it, run it with you, prove 30-50 meetings/month, document everything, train your team, then exit."  
**Why premium:** De-risked investment. You pay for outcomes, not just recommendations.

### 2. International → US Expansion Expertise
**Standard consultant:** Monolingual, no international experience  
**Us:** Brenda's Spanish + Portuguese + Dell 30-country experience  
**Why premium:** Rare capability. Most US consultants can't work with international founders effectively.

### 3. Georgetown MBA + PE Portfolio + Fortune 500 Credibility
**Standard consultant:** Individual freelancer or boutique agency  
**Us:** Georgetown MBA + EigenRev PE work + Dell Fortune 500 + 6sense FP&A  
**Why premium:** Board-level credibility. PE firms don't hire junior talent.

### 4. Complete Coverage (Strategy + Execution + Analytics)
**Standard consultant:** One specialty (Clay expert OR analytics OR strategy)  
**Us:** All three integrated—no coordination overhead across vendors  
**Why premium:** Faster delivery, better integration, single point of accountability.

**Why premium:** We understand YOUR BUYER, not just generic SaaS.

## 💬 Objection Responses (Premium Positioning)

### "This seems expensive compared to a freelancer"
**Response:** "Compare credentials. Freelancers have 2-5 years in one specialty. Brenda has an MBA from Georgetown, 10+ years running revenue operations for PE portfolio companies and Fortune 500 (Dell). Scott has FP&A from 6sense and deep automation expertise. You're hiring senior leadership talent at fractional cost. Would you rather have a junior Clay specialist for $3K who only knows one tool, or a complete GTM partnership for $12K that delivers board-ready analytics and proven results?"

### "Can't we just hire someone full-time?"
**Response:** "Absolutely—once you've proven the system works. Most companies hire a VP Sales prematurely, pay $200K+ salary before they know what works, and burn 12 months learning. We build and prove the system first (6-12 months), then hand off a documented playbook so your new hire hits the ground running on day one. You de-risk the hire and save $200K+ while we prove the model."

### "We already have a CRO"
**Response:** "Perfect—we're the execution team your CRO needs. We augment your CRO's strategy with hands-on execution and data infrastructure. It's like giving your CRO a full revenue operations team without 12-month hiring timeline and $500K+ in salaries."

### "What if we're too small?"
**Response (for international):** "If you have $5M+ revenue in your home market and are serious about US expansion, you're exactly right-sized. The mistake is thinking you need a full US team before proving the model. We help you generate 30-50 US meetings per month BEFORE you hire anyone, so you know the market is real and you can hire confidently."

## 🚀 Next Steps (How to Get Started)

### Discovery Call Questions to Qualify Premium Buyers

**For International Founders:**
1. "What's your current revenue in [home market]?"  
2. "Do you have any US customers yet? How did you acquire them?"  
3. "What's your timeline for US expansion? Are you planning to hire a US-based team?"  
4. "What budget have you allocated for US market entry?"  
5. "Who will own this internally—you, or someone on your team?"

2. "What's your average deal size and sales cycle length?"  
3. "Do you have a RevOps person or team today? What's missing?"

5. "What metrics does your board ask for that you can't easily produce?"

**For PE Portfolio:**
1. "How many portfolio companies need GTM operations support?"  
2. "What's the typical maturity level of GTM in your portfolio?"

5. "Would you be interested in cross-portfolio benchmarking?"

### RED FLAGS (Don't Waste Time on These)
- ❌ Budget under $5K/month (not premium buyers)
- ❌ "Need to prove ROI first with small project" (decision-maker without authority)
- ❌ Solo founder with <$2M revenue and no funding (can't afford premium)
- ❌ "We just need someone to execute our existing plan" (want order-taker, not strategic partner)
- ❌ Individual contributor without C-suite buy-in (will stall)

### GREEN FLAGS (Premium Buyers)
- ✅ Founder/CEO or C-suite on discovery call (decision-maker access)
- ✅ Budget range discussed openly (not defensive about pricing)
- ✅ Timeline urgency (Q1 goals, board deadline, funding milestone)
- ✅ Previous experience with consultants (knows value of expertise)
- ✅ Growth inflection point (proven PMF, now need to scale)
- ✅ "We need this done right" language (values quality over cost)

---

**Remember:** We're premium because of credentials (Georgetown + PE + Fortune 500 + 18 years), our model (Build → Run → Prove → Handoff), and our results (30-50 meetings/month, 90%+ forecast accuracy, 3-5X ROI). Never apologize for premium pricing—it's justified by outcomes and credentials.
