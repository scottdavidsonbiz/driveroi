# Positioning Update: December 9, 2024
**Based on:** 7 conversations across 5 distinct companies (Oct 29 - Nov 24, 2025)
**Note:** Additional conversation with Treasury Hub (SaaS treasury management for W. Africa/LatAm) not included due to lack of transcript
**Analyzed:**
- 2025-10-29: Jeff (IVS Tax Services) - Discovery [NON-SAAS]
- 2025-10-31: Ben (PatientFi) - Clay project scoping [SAAS - Fintech]
- 2025-11-03: Jeff (IVS Tax) - Proposal review [NON-SAAS]
- 2025-11-11: Miguel (IVS Home Health) - Sales planning [NON-SAAS]
- 2025-11-14: Jeffrey & Jennifer (IVS Tax) - Kickoff [NON-SAAS]
- 2025-11-24: Keegan (Voice Brain) - Discovery [SAAS - Public Safety]
- 2025-11-24: Gautier (Environmental data startup) - Discovery [SAAS - Data Platform]

## Executive Summary
**Caveat: Limited data (7-8 conversations) - these are hypotheses to test, not definitive conclusions.**

**Mix breakdown:** 4 SaaS companies (PatientFi, Voice Brain, Gautier's startup, Treasury Hub) vs 3 non-SaaS (IVS Tax, IVS Home Health).

**Key finding:** The strongest prospect (IVS Tax - 3 calls, reached kickoff stage) is a founder-led legacy business with outdated GTM processes. However, this could indicate two distinct opportunities rather than "avoid SaaS":

**Hypothesis 1: Founder-led legacy businesses** (like IVS Tax/Home Health)
- Established (5+ years), 15-50 employees
- Founders/partners are decision-makers with budget authority
- Manual/outdated GTM processes desperately need modernization
- Can't DIY like tech-savvy founders

**Hypothesis 2: SaaS companies in finance/accounting vertical** (like Treasury Hub)
- Leverage your FP&A background from 6sense
- RevOps + finance expertise is rare combination
- You speak their language (metrics, financial planning, revenue operations)
- These companies need someone who understands both GTM AND financial operations

**To avoid:** Individual contributors without budget authority (Ben's $500 offer), regardless of company type or industry.

## Pain Point Patterns

### High Frequency (appeared in 6-7 conversations)

1. **Manual, inefficient GTM processes**
   - Appeared in: ALL 7 conversations
   - Segments: Both SaaS and non-SaaS, all company sizes
   - Examples:
     - Jeff: "Current marketer making excuses, cold calls/email blasts not working"
     - Ben: "Manual LinkedIn research, using free Hunter tool, archaic process"
     - Keegan: "Manually calling police chiefs, can't scale current approach"
     - Gautier: "Pipeline generation, ICP outreach, data enrichment are blurry to me"
   - Our solution: Modern automation infrastructure (Clay, sequencing, intent data) + strategic guidance

2. **Lack of modern infrastructure**
   - Appeared in: 6 conversations (Jeff, Ben, Miguel, Keegan, Gautier)
   - Segments: Primarily non-SaaS and early-stage companies
   - Examples:
     - Jeff: Using Google Sheets as CRM
     - Ben: "Messy CRM (Sugar), incorrect/incomplete data"
     - Keegan: "Lapsed Zoom Info, no sequencing until Clarify releases theirs"
     - Gautier: "Just signed HubSpot last week, need to set up"
   - Our solution: Set up proper tech stack from scratch, infrastructure ownership model

3. **Resource constraints / bandwidth crunch**
   - Appeared in: 5 conversations (Ben, Miguel, Keegan, Gautier, Jeff indirectly)
   - Segments: Across all types, but especially solo operators and small teams
   - Examples:
     - Keegan: "Small team, Keegan wearing all hats (SDR/AE/AM)"
     - Gautier: "Team of one, limited knowledge on certain aspects"
     - Miguel: "Team lacks bandwidth to connect the dots between market data and sales territories"
     - Ben: "Trying to prove ROI with limited personal/company resources"
   - Our solution: Consultative approach that doesn't require hand-holding + automation to save time

### Medium Frequency (appeared in 3-4 conversations)

4. **Strategic uncertainty / lack of clarity on ICP**
   - Appeared in: 4 conversations (Jeff, Miguel, Keegan, Gautier)
   - Examples:
     - Jeff: "No systematic approach to ICP definition, segmentation"
     - Keegan: "Need to decide between federal focus vs. state/local"
     - Gautier: "Still in discovery mode, forming idea of support model"
   - Our solution: ICP definition workshops, data-driven refinement through outreach testing

5. **Current solution actively failing**
   - Appeared in: 3 conversations (Jeff, Ben, Keegan)
   - Examples:
     - Jeff: "Competitors growing while IVS plateaus, current marketer making excuses"
     - Ben: "Acknowledges current process is inefficient"
     - Keegan: "Missing RFP opportunities, finding contracts after due dates"
   - Our solution: Replace failing approach with modern, automated system

### Segment-Specific Pain Points

**Non-SaaS Companies (IVS Tax, IVS Home Health, PatientFi):**
- Outdated, manual processes ("Google Sheets as CRM")
- Legacy industries resisting modernization
- Stagnant growth despite years in business
- Don't know where to start with modern GTM

**Early-Stage Companies (Voice Brain, Gautier's startup):**
- Strategic uncertainty (market focus, ICP definition)
- Need to set up infrastructure from scratch
- Solo operators wearing too many hats
- Need to prove value before scaling investment

**Individual Contributors (Ben):**
- Limited budget authority
- Need quick wins to justify spend
- Pressure to perform with inadequate tools
- Less decision-making power

## Market Segmentation

### Segment 1: Established Non-SaaS Services Businesses (HIGHEST OPPORTUNITY)
- **Profile:** 15-50 employees, 5-25 years in business, legacy industries (professional services, healthcare, fintech services)
- **Sample size:** 3 conversations (IVS Tax, IVS Home Health, PatientFi aspects)
- **Key pain points:**
  - Manual/outdated GTM processes (all)
  - Stagnant growth despite market opportunity (all)
  - Legacy tools or no proper CRM (all)
  - Resource constraints despite established business (all)
- **Buying triggers:**
  - Seasonal/planning cycles creating urgency
  - Growth goals not being met
  - Current solution actively failing
  - Competitive pressure
- **Objections:**
  - Partner buy-in needed
  - Concern about time investment to explain industry
  - Want someone who understands business, not just tech
- **Value props that resonate:**
  - Consultative + technical (not just "tell me what to build")
  - Modern automation vs. manual legacy processes
  - Infrastructure ownership (avoid vendor lock-in)
  - Business acumen ("understands SaaS metrics and scaling mechanics")
- **Assessment:** **STRONGEST FIT.** These companies have budget, urgency, and desperately need what you offer. They're not competing with 1000 RevOps consultants targeting SaaS. Jeff moved through 3 conversations toward kickoff.

### Segment 2: Early-Stage Startups (5-20 employees, scaling)
- **Profile:** Pre-revenue to early revenue, 5-20 employees, rapid growth plans, tech or data companies
- **Sample size:** 2 conversations (Voice Brain, Gautier's startup)
- **Key pain points:**
  - Strategic uncertainty (which market to target)
  - Solo operator with knowledge gaps
  - Need infrastructure from scratch
  - Resource constraints
- **Buying triggers:**
  - Major validation event (funding, big customer win, CRADA)
  - Hiring plans (need infrastructure before reps start)
  - Q1/Q2 planning cycles
  - Just implemented CRM
- **Objections:**
  - Company size ("smaller than your target segment")
  - Timeline (Q1, not immediate)
  - Need to secure buy-in from CEO/partners
- **Value props that resonate:**
  - Consultative approach
  - Set up infrastructure correctly from day one
  - Save SDR/rep time through automation
- **Assessment:** **MODERATE FIT.** They need you but have budget constraints and longer decision cycles. Gautier explicitly said "smaller than target segment" but still wanted to talk. These deals take longer to close.

### Segment 3: Individual GTM Operators at Larger Companies
- **Profile:** SDR/AE/GTM manager at established company, limited budget authority, need to prove ROI
- **Sample size:** 1 conversation (Ben at PatientFi)
- **Key pain points:**
  - Manual work consuming time
  - Messy data
  - Need to prove value before getting company buy-in
- **Buying triggers:**
  - Pressure to perform
  - Need quick wins
  - Budget became available (even if small)
- **Objections:**
  - **MAJOR:** Budget constraints ($500 vs. market rate)
  - Need to prove ROI before spending more
  - Less decision-making authority
- **Value props that resonate:**
  - Quick wins to prove value
  - Phased approach (small scope first)
- **Assessment:** **LOWEST FIT.** Ben offered $500 for work worth $3K+. These prospects lack budget authority and decision-making power. They need to "prove ROI" before committing, which is a red flag for scope creep and undervaluation.

### SaaS vs Non-SaaS Analysis (CORRECTED)

**SaaS Segment:**
- Conversations: 4 (Voice Brain, PatientFi, Gautier's data startup, Treasury Hub)
- Breakdown:
  - **Fintech/Finance:** PatientFi (BNPL), Treasury Hub (treasury management) - 2 companies
  - **Data/AI:** Voice Brain (public safety), Gautier's startup (environmental data) - 2 companies
- Common characteristics: Mix of early-stage (Voice Brain, Gautier) and more established (PatientFi has enterprise sales)
- Saturation assessment: **NUANCED.** General SaaS may be saturated, but there could be sub-segments (e.g., finance/accounting SaaS) where your FP&A background creates differentiation.
- Opportunity: **HYPOTHESIS TO TEST:** Target SaaS companies in finance/accounting vertical where RevOps + FP&A expertise is rare and valuable.

**Non-SaaS Segment:**
- Conversations: 3 (IVS Tax, IVS Home Health) - both founder-led legacy businesses
- Common characteristics:
  - Legacy industries with outdated processes
  - 10-25 years in business but no modern GTM
  - Don't understand modern tools (Jeff using Google Sheets, Miguel can't synthesize data)
  - Willing to pay for expertise because they can't DIY
  - Established revenue but stagnant growth
  - Founders/partners are decision-makers with budget authority
- Opportunity: **HIGH - VALIDATED BY IVS TAX PROGRESS.**
  - IVS Tax moved fastest through pipeline (3 calls, reached kickoff)
  - Founders have budget authority and urgency
  - These companies desperately need modernization
  - Lower competition = higher pricing power

**Key Insight:** It may be less about "SaaS vs non-SaaS" and more about:
1. **Decision-maker access** (founders/partners vs individual contributors)
2. **Budget authority** (established budget vs "need to prove ROI")
3. **Stage** (established 5+ years vs early-stage)
4. **Your unique expertise fit** (finance/accounting SaaS, founder-led legacy businesses)

## Value Proposition Hierarchy

### What We Do Well (backed by conversations)

1. **Consultative + technical hybrid approach**
   - Evidence: Gautier specifically asked about model and responded positively; Jeff liked that Scott "understands metrics and mechanics of scaling"
   - Segments that care: ALL segments, but especially non-SaaS who need hand-holding
   - Competitive advantage: Most consultants are either pure strategy OR pure technical execution, not both

2. **Modernize manual/legacy processes**
   - Evidence: All 7 conversations involved manual processes needing automation
   - Segments that care: Non-SaaS businesses, early-stage companies
   - Competitive advantage: We bring modern SaaS GTM tactics to non-SaaS industries that are 10 years behind

3. **Infrastructure ownership model**
   - Evidence: Jeff specifically called out as a plus that IVS owns all tools/accounts
   - Segments that care: Established businesses concerned about vendor lock-in
   - Competitive advantage: Avoids lock-in, enables easy transition, clients control their own stack

4. **Data-driven ICP refinement**
   - Evidence: Multiple conversations mentioned lack of ICP clarity; Scott's approach of "use outreach to see what messages resonate and refine ICP" resonated
   - Segments that care: Companies with strategic uncertainty, stagnant growth
   - Competitive advantage: Not just "tell me your ICP" but iterative, evidence-based approach

### What We Think We Do (not yet validated)

1. **Save substantial time through automation**
   - Mentioned in: Gautier call ("save SDR time"), implied in others
   - Need to test with: All segments
   - Questions to ask: "How much time per week do you spend on manual research/outreach?" → Quantify time savings in proposals

2. **Improve conversion rates**
   - Mentioned in: Jeff call (LinkedIn 20-30% reply rates vs. 5-10% email)
   - Need to test with: Need case studies and proof points
   - Questions to ask: "What are your current reply rates?" → Benchmark and show improvement

3. **Help channel partner enablement**
   - Mentioned in: Gautier call (B2B2B model, partners not selling solution)
   - Need to test with: Companies with channel/reseller models
   - Questions to ask: Unclear if we have expertise here - need to validate or avoid claiming

## Objections & Concerns

### Recurring Objections

1. **Budget constraints / need to prove ROI first** - 2 occurrences
   - Segments: Individual contributors (Ben), early-stage startups
   - How we're addressing it: Phased approach (Phase 1 vs. Phase 2), infrastructure cost breakdown
   - Gap: Ben's $500 offer suggests we're not qualifying budget early enough. Need to ask "What budget have you allocated for this?" in discovery.

2. **Partner/stakeholder buy-in needed** - 2 occurrences (Jeff needs Jen/James, Gautier needs CEO buy-in)
   - Segments: Established businesses with multiple decision-makers
   - How we're addressing it: Offering group calls, sending materials for internal review
   - Gap: Should we be talking to all stakeholders from the start? Jeff had 3 calls before getting Jennifer involved.

3. **Time investment concern** - 2 occurrences (Miguel/Michelle, implied in Gautier)
   - Segments: Resource-constrained teams
   - How we're addressing it: "Consultative approach that doesn't require hand-holding", infrastructure automation
   - Gap: Need to make this more explicit in positioning. "We don't need you to explain your industry - we ask smart questions and learn fast."

4. **Company size ("smaller than target segment")** - 1 occurrence (Gautier)
   - Segments: Early-stage startups
   - How we're addressing it: Not clearly - Gautier still wanted to talk despite this concern
   - Gap: Need to clarify ICP in marketing. If we DO work with 5-person startups, say so. If we don't, make it clear.

## Open Questions & Gaps

### Segments Not Yet Explored
- **Larger established businesses (50-200 employees):** Do they have the same pain points? Do they have internal resources that make us less necessary?
- **Non-tech industries:** All conversations were tech-adjacent or professional services. What about manufacturing, retail, hospitality?
- **Companies with existing RevOps teams:** Are we helping build the team or augmenting existing teams?

### Unanswered Questions
- **Pricing sensitivity threshold:** What's the budget range for different segments? Jeff at $4K/month moved forward; Ben at $500 did not. Where's the floor?
- **Decision timeline patterns:** Jeff moved fast (3 conversations in 2 weeks); Gautier wants Q1; Voice Brain wants Q1. Is everyone slower in Q4?
- **Channel partner enablement expertise:** Gautier raised this as a pain point. Do we actually know how to solve this? Should we avoid claiming expertise here?
- **Federal sales overlap:** Multiple mentions of federal market (Voice Brain, Gautier, Jeff). Is there an opportunity to bundle Scott's expertise + mom's federal sales expertise as a package?

### Pattern Gaps
- **Win/loss data:** We don't know yet which deals closed. Jeff seemed most promising (3 calls, reached kickoff stage). Need to track outcomes.
- **Referral sources:** Most came through network (Sarah referred multiple, Scott's mom referred Voice Brain). No cold inbound yet. Does this affect ICP?
- **Industry clustering:** 2 IVS companies (different industries), but both progressed. Is there a pattern with company names or shared characteristics?

## Recommended Positioning Updates

### ICP Definition Update (Two Hypotheses to Test)

**BEFORE (assumed):** Early-stage SaaS companies, 10-50 employees, Series A-B, need to scale GTM

**AFTER (hypothesis-based - needs validation with more data):**

**Hypothesis 1: Founder-Led Legacy Services Businesses** ⭐ STRONGEST EARLY SIGNAL
- **Company profile:**
  - 15-50 employees
  - $5M-$50M revenue (estimated based on company size)
  - 5-25 years in business
  - Founder/partners are decision-makers
  - Legacy industries: Professional services, healthcare services, industrial services
  - Currently using manual/outdated GTM processes (spreadsheets, cold calling, spray-and-pray)
- **Pain points:**
  - Stagnant growth despite market opportunity
  - Competitors growing while they plateau
  - Manual GTM processes consuming time
  - No modern CRM or data infrastructure
  - Current marketing/sales approach not working
- **Buying triggers:**
  - Seasonal planning cycles (Q1, fiscal year planning)
  - Growth goals not being met
  - Current solution actively failing (marketer, tools, process)
  - Competitive pressure
- **Why this segment:**
  - **VALIDATED:** IVS Tax moved fastest (3 calls, reached kickoff)
  - Founders have budget authority and make decisions quickly
  - Desperate for modernization but lack expertise
  - Can't DIY like tech-savvy founders
  - Value business acumen + technical skills
- **To test:** Find more founder-led businesses in professional services, healthcare services

**Hypothesis 2: SaaS Companies in Finance/Accounting Vertical** 🧪 UNTESTED BUT PROMISING
- **Company profile:**
  - SaaS/fintech companies serving finance, accounting, treasury, FP&A markets
  - 10-50 employees, Series A-B or bootstrapped with revenue
  - Selling to CFOs, finance teams, accounting departments
- **Your differentiation:**
  - **RevOps + FP&A background from 6sense** = rare combination
  - You speak their language (metrics, financial planning, revenue operations)
  - Understand both their product (finance/accounting) AND their GTM needs
  - Can bridge technical automation with financial planning expertise
- **Examples from conversations:**
  - Treasury Hub (treasury management SaaS)
  - PatientFi (healthcare financing - adjacent to finance)
- **Why this segment:**
  - Your FP&A background creates unique competitive advantage
  - These companies need someone who understands finance deeply
  - Less saturated than general "SaaS RevOps consultant"
- **To test:** Target more finance/accounting SaaS companies, see if FP&A background resonates

**AVOID: Individual contributors without budget authority** ❌
- Red flag: "Need to prove ROI first with small project"
- Red flag: Offering significantly below market rate ($500 for $3K work)
- These deals lead to scope creep and undervaluation
- **Applies to all segments** - decision-maker access is critical

### Messaging Framework Update

**Core message (BEFORE - assumed):**
"We help SaaS companies scale their GTM with modern automation and data infrastructure"

**Core message (AFTER - hypothesis-based):**
"We modernize GTM for founder-led businesses and finance/accounting SaaS companies. We combine business strategy with technical automation - so you can scale without hiring an army of SDRs."

**By segment:**

**Hypothesis 1: Founder-Led Legacy Services Businesses:**
"Your competitors are growing. You're stuck using spreadsheets and cold calls. We bring modern GTM automation to [industry] - Clay, intent data, and systematic ICP targeting. You don't need to understand the technology. You need someone who understands your business AND can build the infrastructure. That's us."

**Hypothesis 2: Finance/Accounting SaaS Companies:**
"Most RevOps consultants don't understand finance. We do. With FP&A experience from 6sense, we speak your language - metrics, financial planning, revenue operations. We understand both your product (finance/accounting) AND your GTM needs. Let us build the automation infrastructure while you focus on your customers."

**Key differentiators to emphasize:**
1. "Consultative + technical" - not just tech execution
2. "Business acumen from SaaS/RevOps/FP&A background" - understand metrics, scaling, and finance
3. "Infrastructure ownership model" - you own your tools, no lock-in
4. For legacy businesses: "Modern automation for legacy industries"
5. For finance SaaS: "RevOps consultant who understands finance deeply"

### Next Conversations Needed

**To validate Hypothesis 1 (Founder-Led Legacy Businesses):**
1. **More founder-led professional services firms (15-50 employees)** - See if IVS Tax pattern repeats
2. **Founder-led healthcare services companies** - IVS Home Health showed promise; test further
3. **Other legacy industries with outdated GTM** - Manufacturing, industrial, B2B services

**To validate Hypothesis 2 (Finance/Accounting SaaS):**
1. **More finance/accounting SaaS companies** - Treasury Hub, expense management, FP&A tools, accounting software
2. **Test FP&A background positioning** - Explicitly mention your 6sense FP&A experience in outreach and see if it resonates
3. **CFO-focused SaaS tools** - Companies selling to finance leaders where you speak the buyer's language

**General validation:**
1. **Decision-maker access pattern** - Continue talking to founders/partners vs individual contributors to validate this matters more than industry
2. **Companies that just implemented CRM** - Test triggering event hypothesis (Gautier just signed HubSpot)
3. **Outcome tracking** - Follow up on Jeff, Miguel, Keegan, Gautier, Treasury Hub to see which segments close

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] **Update website positioning** to focus on "established non-SaaS services businesses" instead of SaaS
- [ ] **Create new messaging** that emphasizes "modernize legacy GTM processes" as core value prop
- [ ] **Add qualifying questions to discovery calls:**
  - "What budget have you allocated for this project?"
  - "Who else needs to be involved in the decision?"
  - "How much time per week does your team spend on manual research/outreach?"
- [ ] **Track win/loss for Jeff, Ben, Miguel, Keegan, Gautier** - Update this doc when outcomes are known

### Near-term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Test new messaging** in next 3-5 discovery calls - Do non-SaaS businesses respond better than SaaS?
- [ ] **Explore professional services vertical more deeply** - IVS Tax was strongest; is there a pattern with consulting/services firms?
- [ ] **Create case study template** for when Jeff closes - Need proof points for "modernize legacy GTM"
- [ ] **Clarify company size targeting** - If 5-person startups are too small, make it explicit in marketing

### Medium-term (Next Month)
- [ ] **Address "time investment" objection proactively** - Add language to website: "We learn fast. You don't need to explain your industry to us - we ask smart questions."
- [ ] **Consider federal sales package** - Multiple mentions of federal market; could partner with mom as bundled offering?
- [ ] **Build out non-SaaS case studies** - As deals close, emphasize industry diversity
- [ ] **Avoid claiming channel partner enablement expertise** until validated - Gautier raised this but unclear if we can deliver

## Key Takeaways for Scott

1. **LIMITED DATA = HYPOTHESES, NOT CONCLUSIONS:** 7-8 conversations isn't enough to be definitive. Frame these as hypotheses to test, not hard rules.

2. **TWO PROMISING SEGMENTS EMERGED:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** Founder-led legacy services businesses (IVS Tax moved fastest - 3 calls, reached kickoff)
   - **Hypothesis 2:** Finance/accounting SaaS (Treasury Hub fits, leverages your FP&A background)

3. **DECISION-MAKER ACCESS MATTERS MORE THAN INDUSTRY:** IVS Tax (founders) moved fast. Ben (individual contributor) offered $500. The pattern may be about WHO you're talking to, not WHAT they sell.

4. **YOUR UNIQUE POSITIONING = CONSULTATIVE + TECHNICAL + FP&A:** Most RevOps consultants don't have FP&A background. This could be your differentiation for finance/accounting SaaS segment.

5. **STOP CHASING LOW BUDGET DEALS:** Ben offered $500 for $3K+ work. Regardless of segment, avoid individual contributors without budget authority.

6. **TEST BOTH HYPOTHESES:** Don't pick one yet. Run parallel experiments:
   - Target more founder-led legacy businesses (validate Hypothesis 1)
   - Target more finance/accounting SaaS (validate Hypothesis 2)
   - Track which segment closes faster and has better economics

7. **NEXT STEPS:**
   - Update website to mention both segments (founder-led businesses + finance/accounting SaaS)
   - Emphasize FP&A background in finance SaaS outreach
   - Track outcomes for current pipeline to see which hypothesis validates
   - Aim for 10-15 more conversations before making definitive positioning call
