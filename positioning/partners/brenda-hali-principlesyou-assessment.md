## Final Assessment: PARTIALLY COMPLEMENTARY, BUT MISSING KEY PIECES

**The partnership COULD work if:**

1. **They hire for their shared weaknesses:**
   - Hire a **COO/Operations Manager** who is:
     - High practical thinking
     - High detail-oriented
     - Systematic and process-driven
     - Handles day-to-day execution

2. **They hire for client relationships:**
   - Hire a **Client Success Manager** who is:
     - High empathy
     - High people-oriented
     - Nurturing and supportive

3. **They acknowledge the systems vs. intuition dynamic:**
   - Scott builds the frameworks
   - Brenda has flexibility to adapt them
   - They agree upfront: "We build systems, but allow for adaptation"

4. **They manage recognition needs:**
   - Brenda gets client-facing role (satisfies status needs)
   - Scott stays behind scenes (comfortable for him)
   - Public credit goes to Brenda, strategic credit to Scott

**The partnership will STRUGGLE if:**

1. They try to do everything themselves (their shared weaknesses will hurt them)
2. Scott builds rigid systems that Brenda can't adapt
3. They compete for client relationships (neither has empathy for it)
4. They both need recognition and there's not enough to go around
5. Nobody catches the practical constraints and details

---

**For Friday's Partnership Meeting:**

This analysis should inform the division of labor discussion AND hiring strategy. They're not fully complementary - they need to hire for practical execution, details, and people skills.
