1. Where do you score on empathy/nurturing? (Scott is 39%)
2. Are you more practical or conceptual? (Scott is conceptual)
3. How detail-oriented are you? (Scott is 29%)
4. How creative/innovative are you? (Scott is 37%)
5. Do you need external validation or are you internally motivated? (Scott needs external)
6. Are you comfortable being collaborative vs. leading? (Scott is high leadership/demanding)
