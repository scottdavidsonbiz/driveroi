# Blended Strategy Summary

**Date:** December 19, 2025
**Decision:** Blend Q126 scalable model with premium positioning for upmarket transition

---

## The Strategy in One Sentence

**Start with accessible pricing ($7.5K-$13.5K) to build client base and proof points, then move upmarket ($15K-$25K+) once we have credibility and case studies.**

---

## Why This Approach?

### Phase 1 (2026): SCALE - Volume & Proof Points
**Problem:** No clients, no testimonials, no case studies
**Solution:** Accessible pricing attracts more clients faster
**Goal:** 6-7 clients at $10K-$13.5K avg = $60K-$95K MRR
**Outcome:** Testimonials, case studies, repeatable delivery playbooks

### Phase 2 (2027): PREMIUM - Fewer Clients, Higher Value
**Problem:** Too many clients, capacity constraints
**Solution:** Move upmarket, replace 3 lower-tier clients with 1-2 premium
**Goal:** 4-5 clients at $18K-$25K = $72K-$125K MRR
**Outcome:** Higher margins, strategic partnerships, equity deals

---

## Pricing Comparison

| Service Model | Growth Track (2026) | Premium Track (2027+) |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Done-for-You Setup** | $18K-$55K one-time | Same (keep this) |
| **Managed Services** | $7.5K-$22K/month | N/A (retire low tier) |
| **Fractional Ops** | $18K/month | N/A (evolve to premium) |
| **US Market Entry** | $7.5K-$10K/month | $10K-$15K/month |
| **Vertical SaaS** | $10K-$13.5K/month | $12K-$18K/month |
| **Complete RevOps** | $18K-$22K/month | $18K-$25K/month |
| **PE Portfolio Bundle** | $6K/month per co | $8K-$10K/month per co |

**Key Changes:**
- 2026: Emphasize $7.5K-$13.5K range (accessible, scalable)
- 2027: Retire Tier 1 ($7.5K), focus on $15K+ only
- Keep one-time setup option (good for all phases)

---

## Service Model Evolution

### 2026: Three Service Models

**Model 1: Done-For-You Setup** ($18K-$55K one-time)
- Best for: Early-stage, legacy businesses, "set it up for us" clients
- Capacity: Can handle 2-3 setups simultaneously (6-8 weeks each)
- Margin: High (one-time payment, limited ongoing support)

**Model 2: Managed Services** ($7.5K-$22K/month)
- Best for: Series A-B SaaS, PE portfolio companies, companies needing hands-off management
- Capacity: 5-7 clients (mix of Tier 1/2/3)
- Margin: Medium (recurring, predictable)

**Model 3: Fractional Strategy** ($18K/month)
- Best for: Series B-C preparing to hire CRO/VP RevOps
- Capacity: 1-2 clients max (high-touch)
- Margin: High (25-30 hours/month = $600-720/hour effective rate)

### 2027: Two Service Models

**Model 1: Done-For-You Setup** ($32K-$55K one-time) - Keep Tier 2-3 only
- Retire Foundation Build ($18K) - too low-margin
- Focus on Growth Stack ($32K) and Enterprise ($55K)

**Model 2: Premium Partnerships** ($15K-$25K/month + equity)
- US Market Entry: $10K-$15K/month
- Vertical SaaS: $12K-$18K/month
- Complete RevOps: $18K-$25K/month (+ 0.25-1% equity)
- Build → Run → Prove → Handoff model
- Georgetown MBA + PE portfolio credibility positioning
