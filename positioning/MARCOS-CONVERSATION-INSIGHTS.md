# Key Insights from Marcos Conversation
**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Source:** Transcript of Marcos × Scott × Brenda discovery call

---

## 🎯 Client Need: What Marcos Actually Wants

### Not What We Initially Thought
**Scott's initial proposal:** Set up campaigns (2 or 4 campaigns), deliver them, move on  
**What Marcos actually needs:** Long-term partnership to build, run, and optimize outbound engine before hiring SDR

### What Marcos is Actually Buying
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Setup**
   - Build outbound engine foundations
   - Set up infrastructure (CRM, Clay, intent data, etc.)
   - Start with manual approach, then automate progressively
   - "Warm up inboxes," set up tools properly

2. **Phase 2 (Months 3-9+): Run the Engine**
   - **Critically:** Marcos wants us to RUN the engine with him, not just set it up and disappear
   - Execute campaigns daily with ongoing coaching
   - Weekly calls to review "what's working, what's not"
   - Iterative optimization based on real data
   - "I'm willing to execute, but I need your expert support to iterate and improve"

3. **Phase 3 (Months 9-12): Handoff**
   - After proving the engine works (generating consistent demos), THEN hire SDR
   - Hand off documented playbook
   - "I want to be in a position where I can explain the playbook to someone else"

### Key Quote from Marcos
> "I do need to set it up. And then I need to run it. So it's not that you mentioned two campaigns or four campaigns and fine. But you know, the purpose here is to do many campaigns, right? It's not the purpose of okay, four campaigns and I don't need you anymore. That's not where I'm coming from."

> "I do want to be in a situation where this is being proven and then I can have a clear playbook that I can explain to someone else. For the first year, let's say, I'm willing to work with you and execute."

## 💎 Our Updated Service Model (Build → Run → Prove → Handoff)

### Traditional Consultant Model (What Marcos DON'T Want)
- Set up tech stack
- Deliver 2-4 campaigns
- Hand off and disappear
- Client left to figure out optimization alone
- No ongoing support

### Our Premium Model (What Marcos DOES Want)
**Phase 1: Build (Months 1-2)**
- Set up infrastructure (more manual initially, automate progressively)
- Define ICP, segment accounts, enrich data
- Create initial messaging and sequences
- Launch first campaigns

**Phase 2: Run (Months 3-9)**
- **Weekly/bi-weekly coaching calls:** "What's working? What's not? Where do you need assistance?"
- **Hands-on execution support:** Help Marcos execute specific steps
- **Iterative optimization:** Test, measure, refine based on real performance data
- **Progressive automation:** Start manual → automate as patterns emerge
- **This is the CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATOR:** We don't disappear after setup

**Phase 3: Prove (Months 9-12)**
- System is generating consistent results (Marcos' goal: 50 demos/month)
- Documented playbook showing what works
- Ready to hand off to new hire

**Phase 4: Handoff (Month 12+)**
- Clear playbook for new SDR hire
- Onboarding support for new hire
- Ongoing advisory as needed

## 💰 Pricing Insights

### Marcos' Budget
- **$2,000/month** (all-in, including tools)
- **Timeline:** 12 months minimum
- **Total investment:** ~$24K for first year

### Our Positioning Response
**What we can do at $2K/month:**
- Start with basic tools (minimize automation costs initially)
- Manual processes for first 3 months (Scott executes with Marcos, Brenda advises)
- Progressive automation as budget allows
- Focus on proving the model before investing in expensive automation

**What we clarified:**
> "We can get started and build some lists... We'll definitely help you to define [strategy]. I just want to see how defined and what we can make out of your strategy. Meaning that what type of data we find based on your strategy. We'll check our systems and then with that, I think it's really straightforward."

**Budget-conscious approach Brenda proposed:**
- Start with $2K including tools
- "We can definitely help you with this and with the strategy overall"
- "We can definitely collaborate with you"
- Adapt to budget constraints: "We can get scrappy quite honestly and adapting to your budget"

---

## 🌍 International Market Focus (New Positioning Validated)

### Marcos' Target Markets
- **Mexico:** Already has 1 paying customer + several qualified leads, local helper sourcing leads
- **West Africa:** Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya (though Kenya is East Africa)
- **Fintech focus:** Sweet spot but not restricted to fintech

### Brenda's International Positioning (Key Moment in Call)
> "What we do, we help companies from other countries to enter the US market, which is a really different play than let's say, enter into to auditories [other markets]. We specialize in helping firms entering the US market because it is really different. We can definitely help you with this and with the strategy overall, but what we do, we help companies from other countries to enter the US market... that is our niche."

**INSIGHT:** Brenda is positioning them as **US market entry specialists**, NOT as generalists who can help with any market.

**Marcos' response:** 
> "I think there's room in emerging markets that have been traditionally more overlooked in our space... The US market is more mature... in emerging markets is because in our space, it's more empty. So there's less competition and so many opportunities."

**POSITIONING OPPORTUNITY:** 
- Primary niche: Foreign companies entering US market (Brenda's stated positioning)
- Secondary/complementary: US/international companies entering emerging markets (where there's less competition and more opportunity)

## 🎯 Success Criteria (What Marcos Measures Us On)

### Marcos' Success Definition
> "What success looks to me is... the outbound engine generates around 50 demos per month."

### Important Clarification
**NOT our problem if:**
- After the demo, Marcos can't close the deal
- Marcos can't persuade them to sign NDA or contract
- Demo gets postponed or rescheduled

**WHAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY:**
- Positive replies (qualified leads interested in demo)
- Demo bookings (qualified leads on calendar)
- Engine structure and functionality (proper setup, ongoing optimization)

### His Quote:
> "If after setting up this outbound engine, I'm not able to close deals, that's my problem. Not yours... What I do expect from you is that the outbound engine is built correctly and generates around 50 demos per month."

**INSIGHT:** Clear success criteria = 50 demos/month. Everything before the demo (engine setup, lead quality, booking rate) is our responsibility. Everything after (demo quality, close rate) is his.

## 🚀 GTM Strategy Insights (What We Need from Client)

### Brenda's Smart Discovery Questions
1. **"What is your goal?"** (What do you want to achieve in next 3 months?)
2. **"Are you piloting in any specific countries or businesses?"**
3. **"What is your budget to spend on tech, but also on us running this engine?"**
4. **"Do you have any proven data on things that have worked for you?"** (So we can build on success patterns)
5. **"How does success look like for you?"** (Define the end goal clearly)
6. **"Where is the handoff?"** (When do we transition from running it to them owning it?)

### What Marcos Has (Assets We Can Build On)
- **1 paying customer in Mexico**
- **2 customers about to sign**
- **Several qualified leads** (not paying yet but interested)
- **Local helper in Mexico** sourcing leads (not systematic engine though)
- **Person helping in Mexico:** Already doing some outbound, but "not an engine"
- **Clear ICP emerging:** Fintech in Mexico and West Africa

### What Marcos Needs from Us (ICP Clarity)
> "I will share with you as much context as possible regarding ICP and current customers and profile, like countries and what I'm targeting."

**Next step after this call:** Marcos to send ICP documentation, then reconvene to propose approach

## 🤝 Partnership Model Insights

### Marcos' Hiring Philosophy
> "I prefer to keep it lean until the system is proved... It's easy to hire people and you just need the budget. But what's difficult is to bring them on board with a proven system and proven playbook."

**INSIGHT:** He's smart. He knows not to hire SDR prematurely. Wants to prove the model first, then hire with documented playbook.

**Our value:** We're the "proving phase" before he scales with hires.

### Marcos is Open to Future Collaboration
> "Once it's been fully proven inside out... you might be able to help out with inbound. I'm happy to consider other ways to collaborate."

**INSIGHT:** If we prove value on outbound, there's opportunity to expand to inbound, other markets, other services. Land and expand model.

### Ideal Engagement Length
- **Minimum:** 6 months (build and start proving)
- **Ideal:** 12 months (build, prove, optimize, handoff)
- **Possibility:** Ongoing advisory after handoff

## 💡 Service Delivery Insights (How We Should Work)

### What Marcos Values
1. **Expert guidance:** "I need your expert support to iterate and improve"
2. **Flexibility:** "We can start more manual, then automate" (phased approach)
3. **Collaboration:** "I'm willing to execute, but I need you coaching me"
4. **Transparency:** "Let's define really clearly where is the handoff"
5. **Proven results:** "I want to be in a position where I can explain the playbook to someone else"

### Red Flags Marcos is Avoiding
- **Order-taker consultants:** Who just build what you ask for without strategic input
- **Disappearing consultants:** Who set up and vanish without ongoing support
- **Expensive automation:** That doesn't prove ROI before scaling investment

### Green Flags (Why This is a Good Client)
- ✅ **Clear budget:** $2K/month stated upfront
- ✅ **Realistic timeline:** 12 months, not "need results in 30 days"
- ✅ **Founder-led:** Marcos is CEO, decision-maker (no bureaucracy)
- ✅ **Execution mindset:** "I'm willing to execute" (not just delegating)
- ✅ **Has traction:** 1 paying customer, 2 about to sign, several leads (proven PMF)
- ✅ **Clear success metrics:** 50 demos/month (measurable goal)
- ✅ **Open to ongoing partnership:** Mentioned inbound, other collaboration possibilities

## 🔄 How This Changes Our Positioning

### OLD POSITIONING (What Scott Proposed Initially)
**Service:** Set up campaigns (2 or 4 campaigns), deliver, move on  
**Duration:** Project-based (maybe 3-6 months)  
**Client expectation:** Consultant delivers campaigns, client runs them independently  
**Risk:** Client left alone after setup, might not know how to optimize

### NEW POSITIONING (What Marcos Revealed We Should Offer)
**Service:** Build → Run → Prove → Handoff (12-month partnership)  
**Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Build infrastructure (more manual initially)  
**Phase 2 (Months 3-9):** Run the engine WITH client, weekly coaching, iterative optimization  
**Phase 3 (Months 9-12):** Prove results (50 demos/month), document playbook, prepare for handoff  
**Phase 4 (Month 12+):** Handoff to new hire with ongoing advisory  
**Client expectation:** We're partners through the entire proving phase, not just setup  
**Risk mitigation:** We're there to optimize until results are proven

### Why This is BETTER Positioning (Premium Justification)
1. **Longer engagement = more revenue:** 12 months vs. 3-6 months
2. **Stickier relationship:** We're embedded in their operations, not transactional
3. **Better results:** Ongoing optimization beats "set it and forget it"
4. **Clear success criteria:** 50 demos/month = measurable outcome we own
5. **Differentiation:** Most consultants don't offer this ongoing partnership model
6. **Premium pricing justified:** $2K × 12 months = $24K total. For that, client gets proven engine + documented playbook + trained team. That's premium value.

## 🎤 Updated Elevator Pitch (Based on Marcos Insights)

### Before (Old Positioning)
"We set up your outbound engine—Clay, CRM, sequences, automation. You'll be ready to generate pipeline in 6-8 weeks."

### After (New Positioning - Premium Model)
"We don't just set up your outbound engine—we build it, run it with you, and optimize it until you're consistently generating 30-50 demos per month. Then we hand off a documented playbook so you can hire your first SDR confidently, knowing exactly what works. Most consultants disappear after setup. We stay with you through the proving phase. That's why we're premium."

## 💎 Key Quotes to Use in Marketing

### From Marcos (Validates Our New Positioning)
> "The purpose here is to do many campaigns, right? It's not the purpose of okay, four campaigns and I don't need you anymore."

> "I do want to be in a situation where this is being proven and then I can have a clear playbook that I can explain to someone else."

> "For the first year, I'm willing to work with you and execute."

### From Brenda (Our International Positioning)
> "We help companies from other countries to enter the US market... that is our niche."

### New Marketing Message
**Headline:** "We Don't Just Build Your Outbound Engine—We Run It With You Until It's Proven"

**Body:** "Most consultants set up your CRM, deliver a few campaigns, and disappear. You're left alone to figure out what works. We're different. We build your outbound engine, run it with you for 6-12 months, optimize weekly based on real data, and don't exit until you're consistently generating 30-50 qualified demos per month. Then we hand off a documented playbook so you can hire your first SDR confidently, knowing exactly what works. That's why we're premium."

## 🎯 Bottom Line: What We Learned from Marcos

1. **Clients want ongoing partnership, not transactional projects:** Marcos doesn't want 4 campaigns and done. He wants 12 months of partnership.

2. **"Build → Run → Prove → Handoff" is our premium differentiator:** Most consultants don't offer the "Run" phase. We do. That's premium.

3. **Clear success criteria matters:** 50 demos/month = measurable outcome. Helps both sides know when we've succeeded.

4. **International market entry is real demand:** Brenda's positioning as "US market entry specialists" resonates, but emerging markets (Mexico, West Africa) also need GTM support.

5. **Budget-conscious doesn't mean cheap:** Marcos has $2K/month budget, but over 12 months that's $24K. Premium engagement if we deliver proven results.

6. **Founders want documented playbooks:** They don't just want results—they want the system documented so they can scale after we leave. That's transferable value.

7. **Progressive automation makes sense:** Start manual (low cost, high learning), then automate as patterns emerge. This fits tight budgets and reduces risk.

**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Next Action:** Wait for Marcos to send ICP documentation, then create tailored proposal using this new "Build → Run → Prove → Handoff" model.
