# SPICED Discovery Call Template - DriveROI

**Purpose:** Qualify prospects and diagnose their GTM infrastructure needs using the SPICED framework.

**Target:** SaaS companies, $5M-$30M ARR, need help with Clay/RevOps/GTM infrastructure

---

## Pre-Call Research (5 min)

Before the call, find:
- [ ] Company size (headcount, funding stage)
- [ ] Tech stack (BuiltWith, LinkedIn, job postings)
- [ ] Recent news (funding, hiring, leadership changes)
- [ ] LinkedIn profile of the person you're meeting

---

## Opening (2 min)

> "Thanks for taking the time. Before I tell you about us, I'd love to understand what's going on at [Company] and what prompted you to take this call. Then we can figure out if there's a fit."

**Goal:** Let them talk first. Don't pitch.

---

## S - Situation (5 min)

### Questions

1. **"Walk me through how a lead goes from first touch to closed deal today."**
   - Listen for: manual steps, tools mentioned, handoffs

2. **"What does your sales/GTM team look like right now?"**
   - Listen for: team size, roles, who does what

3. **"What tools are you using?"**
   - CRM: HubSpot? Salesforce? Other?
   - Enrichment: Apollo? ZoomInfo? Clay? Manual?
   - Outreach: Outreach? Salesloft? Instantly? Manual?

4. **"How long have you been doing it this way?"**
   - Listen for: "since we started" = never built systems

### What You're Listening For

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| "We use spreadsheets for..." | No systems, good fit |
| "Our CRM is a mess" | Data quality issues, good fit |
| "Reps do their own research" | No enrichment, good fit |
| "We have a RevOps person" | May have help already, dig deeper |
| "We just implemented Clay" | Might need help optimizing, not building |

### Notes Template

```
SITUATION
- Team size:
- CRM:
- Enrichment:
- Outreach tools:
- Current process:
```

---

## P - Pain (5-7 min)

### Questions

1. **"What's not working about the current setup?"**
   - Let them vent. Don't interrupt.

2. **"Where do your reps waste the most time?"**
   - Listen for: research, data entry, finding contacts, updating CRM

3. **"What don't you have visibility into that you wish you did?"**
   - Listen for: pipeline, lead source, conversion rates, rep activity

4. **"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"**
   - This often reveals the real priority

5. **"What have you tried before? What happened?"**
   - Listen for: past failures, what didn't work, burned by agencies

### Pain Signals for DriveROI

| Pain Statement | Service Fit |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Reps spend hours researching accounts" | Clay enrichment + automation |
| "Our CRM data is garbage" | CRM cleanup + data ops |
| "We don't know which leads to prioritize" | Lead scoring + routing |
| "New reps take forever to ramp" | Process documentation + systems |
| "We can't track what's working" | Reporting + analytics |
| "We tried outbound but it didn't work" | Infrastructure rebuild |

- Primary pain:
- Secondary pains:

- Why it didn't work:

## I - Impact (5 min)

### Questions

1. **"What does that cost you?"**
   - Push for specifics: hours, dollars, deals

2. **"How many deals do you think fall through the cracks because of this?"**
   - Get them to quantify

3. **"What does that mean for hitting your targets this year?"**
   - Connect pain to business outcomes

4. **"How does this affect your team?"**
   - Listen for: burnout, turnover, frustration

5. **"What happens if this doesn't get fixed in the next 6-12 months?"**
   - Future pacing the pain

### Impact Quantification Prompts

Help them do the math:

> "If your reps spend 2 hours a day on research, that's 10 hours a week. Times 5 reps, that's 50 hours. What's that worth in deals they could be closing instead?"

> "If 20% of your leads don't get followed up because of CRM issues, and your average deal is $50K, how many deals is that per quarter?"

### Notes Template

```
IMPACT
- Time cost:
- Revenue cost:
- Team impact:
- Risk if not solved:
```

---

## C - Critical Event (3-5 min)

### Questions

1. **"What's driving the timing on this?"**
   - THE most important question

2. **"Why are you looking at this now vs. 6 months ago?"**
   - Find the trigger

3. **"Is there a deadline you're working toward?"**
   - Board meeting, funding milestone, hiring start date

4. **"What happens if you don't solve this by [date]?"**
   - Create urgency if real

### Common Critical Events

| Critical Event | Urgency Level |
|----------------|---------------|
| Just raised funding | High - need to deploy capital |
| New VP Sales/CRO joined | High - wants quick wins |
| Board meeting in X weeks | High - need to show progress |
| Hiring SDRs next quarter | High - need systems before they start |
| Missed quota last quarter | Medium - pain is fresh |
| Renewal coming up on tool | Medium - decision point |
| "Just exploring" | Low - no urgency, nurture |

### No Critical Event = No Deal

If they can't articulate why NOW, the deal will stall. Either:
- Help them find/create urgency
- Nurture and come back later
- Qualify out

### Notes Template

```
CRITICAL EVENT
- Trigger:
- Deadline:
- Consequence if missed:
```

   - Understand their buying motion

3. **"What criteria matter most to you when choosing a partner for this?"**
   - Learn what to emphasize in proposal

   - Learn from past buying behavior

5. **"What would make you say no?"**
   - Surface objections early

## Wrap-Up (3-5 min)

### Summarize Their SPICED

> "Let me make sure I understood this correctly. You're a [Situation], and the main challenge is [Pain]. That's costing you [Impact]. The reason you're looking at this now is [Critical Event], and to move forward you'd need [Decision process]. Did I get that right?"

### If Qualified - Next Steps

> 1. I'll put together a proposal that addresses [specific pain]
> 2. We should schedule a follow-up with [other stakeholder] if needed
> 3. Target to have something to you by [date]
>
> Does that work?"

### If Not Qualified

## Quick Reference: Red Flags vs. Green Flags

### Green Flags (Qualified)

- Clear pain with quantifiable impact
- Critical event with real deadline
- Decision maker on the call
- Budget exists or can be created
- Tried to solve this before (knows it's hard)
- Asks good questions about your process

### Red Flags (Likely Not Qualified)

- "Just exploring" with no trigger
- Can't articulate the pain
- No budget and no path to budget
- Too many decision makers / consensus culture
- Wants you to "prove it" with free work
- Bad-mouths all past vendors

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're too early for this" | "When are you planning to hire your next sales rep? We typically want systems in place 60 days before they start." |
| "We tried this before and it didn't work" | "What happened? I want to make sure we don't repeat that." |
| "Can you just give us a proposal?" | "I could, but it would be generic. 15 more minutes now saves us both time later. What does [specific pain] cost you today?" |
| "We're talking to other vendors" | "Makes sense. What criteria matter most to you? I want to make sure I address those." |
| "This isn't a priority right now" | "Got it. What would need to change for it to become a priority?" |
