# Objection: Pricing/Budget Concerns

## The Objection
"Is $4K/month too high for our budget?" or "We need to review this with partners/leadership before committing."

---

## How It Manifests

### IVS Tax Services Example

**Implicit Budget Concern:**
- Jeffrey interested but didn't commit immediately
- Mentioned need to review with partners (Jen + James)
- Fort Worth trip to discuss = decision by committee
- Delay in decision (not price rejection, but alignment needed)

**Actual Investment:**
- **Proposed:** $4K/month + $500-600 infrastructure = $4,500-4,600/month
- **3-month minimum:** $13,500-13,800 total commitment
- **For context:** Already spending $10K+/year on ZoomInfo with poor ROI

**Not a "No"—a "Need to Align"**

---

## Why It Comes Up

### Sticker Shock
- **First reaction:** $4K/month sounds expensive (especially for small business)
- **Mental comparison:** Vs. current marketer (likely cheaper), vs. DIY (free), vs. doing nothing

### Multiple Decision-Makers
- **IVS:** 3 partners (Jeffrey, Jennifer, James)
- **Consensus needed:** All must agree to investment
- **Delay inevitable:** Scheduling partner discussion, aligning priorities

### Risk Aversion
- **"What if this doesn't work?"**
- **"We've been burned before"** (current marketer, ZoomInfo low ROI)
- **"Can we afford to waste $13K-14K?"**

### Comparison to Failed Investments
- **ZoomInfo:** $10K+/year, low ROI, questioning value
- **Current marketer:** Paying someone, getting no results
- **Pattern:** "We've invested before and didn't get results"

## How Scott Handled It (IVS)

### Proposal Presentation (11/3)

**1. Provided Market Context**
> "Competitors charge $3K-10K/month range"

**Translation:** $4K is mid-market, not premium

**2. Broke Down Value Components**
- **Phase 1:** $4K/month (ICP definition, campaign launch, bi-weekly reviews, weekly reports)
- **Infrastructure:** $500-600/month (tools IVS owns: Clay, LinkedIn automation, email automation, domains)
- **Phase 2:** $5.5K/month (optional—CRM, advanced workflows)

**Translation:** Here's what you're paying for (transparency)

**3. Positioned Ownership Model**
> "You own all tools/accounts - no vendor lock-in"

**Why this matters:**
- Not paying Scott for tools (IVS owns them)
- Can leave anytime after 3 months (tools stay with IVS)
- Builds IVS capability (not dependent on Scott forever)

**4. Created Safety Net**
> "3-month minimum, 30-day out clause after"

**Translation:** Low commitment, can exit if not working

**5. Tied to Business Outcomes**
> "You need $400K new business. Average deal is $50K. That's 8-10 contracts."

**Math:**
- Investment: $13.5K-13.8K (3 months)
- One deal closes: $50K revenue
- **ROI:** 3.6x minimum (if just ONE deal closes)

**Translation:** This is a no-brainer if it works

**6. Made It Low-Risk**
- Test Phase 1 (3 months)
- Decide on Phase 2 later
- No long-term obligation
- Own the infrastructure (can continue without Scott)

---

### What Closed It (IVS Factors)

1. **Urgency:** Tax season window closing (opportunity cost > price concern)
2. **Frustration:** Current marketer failing (wasting money anyway)
3. **Ownership:** IVS owns tools (not paying for vendor lock-in)
4. **Safety net:** 3-month test, can exit if not working
5. **ROI:** One deal = 3.6x ROI (compelling math)

## Objection Handling Playbook

### "That's expensive / too high for our budget"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge:** "I understand $4K/month is an investment"
2. **Contextualize:** "Competitors charge $3K-10K. We're mid-market because [value drivers]"
3. **Break down:** "Here's what you're getting: [deliverables]. Here's what you own: [tools]"
4. **Tie to outcomes:** "You need $[revenue target]. One deal = [X]x ROI. How many deals would make this worth it?"
5. **De-risk:** "3-month test. If it's not working, you can exit. But you'll own the infrastructure either way."

---

### "We need to review with partners/leadership"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Expect it:** "Of course - this is a meaningful investment. Who needs to be involved in the decision?"
2. **Facilitate:** "What's the best way to get everyone aligned? Group call? Presentation?"
3. **Provide materials:** "I'll send the proposal, pricing breakdown, and contract for review"
4. **Set timeline:** "When do you think you'll have a decision? I ask because [urgency factor]"
5. **Address concerns:** "What questions or concerns do you anticipate coming up? Let me address those now"

---

### "We've invested in [tool/agency] before and it didn't work"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Validate:** "I understand - you've been burned before. That makes you cautious, rightfully so"
2. **Differentiate:** "Here's why [previous solution] didn't work: [reason]. Here's what we do differently: [differentiation]"
3. **De-risk:** "I don't want to be another failed investment. That's why we structure it as: [safety net]"
4. **Ownership:** "Unlike agencies, you own everything. If we part ways, you keep the infrastructure and can continue"
5. **Transparency:** "Bi-weekly calls, weekly reports - you'll see exactly what's happening, not a black box"

---

### "Can we start smaller / test with less investment?"

**Response Framework:**
1. **Acknowledge desire:** "I appreciate wanting to test before fully committing"
2. **Explain minimum:** "3 months is the minimum because [reason: ICP setup, campaign launch, time to iterate]"
3. **Alternative:** "You could do Phase 1 (3 months, $4K/month) and skip Phase 2 entirely. That's the test"
4. **Show math:** "Going smaller means [less volume / less learnings / longer time to results]. Here's the trade-off: [explain]"
5. **Safety net:** "You can exit after 3 months if it's not working. That's your 'test'"

## When Pricing Is NOT the Real Objection

### Signs It's Not About Price

1. **They're already spending money:** IVS paying $10K+/year for ZoomInfo + marketer
2. **They mention ROI, not cost:** "Will this work?" not "That's too expensive"
3. **They ask about outcomes:** "How many meetings can we expect?" not "Can you discount?"
4. **They need alignment:** "I need to talk to partners" not "We can't afford this"

**Translation:** Not a budget issue—a **value/risk/alignment** issue

### Real Objections Underneath

1. **Risk:** "What if this doesn't work?" → Address with safety net, benchmarks, transparency
2. **Skepticism:** "We've been burned before" → Address with differentiation, ownership model
3. **Alignment:** "Partners need to agree" → Address with materials, facilitation, timeline
4. **Urgency:** "Is now the right time?" → Address with seasonal window, opportunity cost

## Pattern Status

**Validation Count:** 1 client (IVS Tax Services)

**Status:** Hypothesis (need 2 more to validate)

**Next Validations:**
- [ ] Client 2: Do they also have pricing concerns / need partner alignment?
- [ ] Client 3: Do they also ask "what if this doesn't work?"
- [ ] If YES to both → Promote to **Pattern: "Pricing objection = risk/alignment concern"**

**Potential Learnings:**
- At what price point does this objection come up? ($3K? $5K? $10K?)
- For what company sizes? (< $5M revenue? < 20 employees?)
- What closes it? (Urgency? ROI math? Safety net? Ownership model?)

---

## When to Reference This Objection

### In Future Client Conversations
- **If prospect says:** "That's expensive" or "We need to review internally"
- **If prospect asks:** "What if this doesn't work?" or "Can we test smaller?"
- **If prospect mentions:** Multiple decision-makers, consensus needed

### In Proposal Development
- **Preempt:** Build ROI math into proposal (show cost vs. opportunity)
- **De-risk:** Highlight safety net, ownership model, exit clause
- **Breakdown:** Itemize deliverables + infrastructure (transparency)

### In Sales Enablement
- **Qualification:** Multiple decision-makers = longer sales cycle (plan for it)
- **Positioning:** Lead with ownership model, safety net (de-risks before objection comes up)
- **Closing:** Use urgency to compress timeline ("seasonal window closing")
