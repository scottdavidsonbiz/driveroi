# ICP Pattern: Property Tax Consulting (Industrial Focus)

**⚠️ CLIENT-SPECIFIC PATTERN - Do NOT Generalize**

This ICP is specific to IVS Tax Services and should NOT be used as a template for other clients unless they're also in property tax consulting.

---

## ICP Summary
Property tax consulting firms targeting industrial manufacturers/distributors with high-value property holdings.

---

## ICP Definition (IVS Tax Services)

### Industries (Vertical)
**Primary:** Industrial properties
- Refineries
- Oil & gas facilities
- Pulp & paper mills
- Chemical manufacturing plants
- Food & beverage processing facilities

**Why these industries:**
- Heavy assets (buildings, equipment, land)
- High property tax bills (10-15% reduction = significant savings)
- Complex valuations (need expertise)
- Multiple properties/locations (recurring revenue opportunity)

**Avoided:**
- Home services (residential, not B2B)
- B2C businesses (not IVS's expertise)
- Low-asset businesses (software, services - low property tax exposure)

---

### Company Size
**Range:** "Mom and pop to Fortune 500"

**Sweet Spot:** TBD (need campaign data to identify)
- Small: Owner-operated, handful of properties
- Mid-market: Regional chains, multiple locations
- Enterprise: Fortune 500, national/international footprint

**Geographic:** Primarily US (IVS's service area)

---

### Decision-Makers (Personas)

**Primary:**
- CFOs (budget authority, tax oversight)
- Tax managers/directors (day-to-day responsibility)
- Controllers (financial operations)

**Secondary:**
- VP Finance
- Accounting managers
- Operations directors (if they own property decisions)

**Buying Committee:**
- CFO (approves budget)
- Tax manager (evaluates expertise)
- Operations (assesses service delivery)
- Legal (reviews contracts, compliance)

---

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
**IVS's assessment:** "Almost any manufacturer/distributor in US with property holdings"

**Realistic TAM:**
- Industrial manufacturers (US): ~300K companies
- With significant property holdings: ~50K-100K (estimate)
- Actively seeking property tax consulting: 1-5% annually
- **Addressable:** 500-5,000 companies/year

---

## Intent Signals (Buying Triggers)

### 1. Job Changes
- **New CFO** (0-90 days in role): Reviewing vendors, looking for savings
- **New tax manager** (0-90 days): Establishing processes, evaluating current approach
- **New controller** (0-90 days): Exploring cost reduction opportunities

**Why this works:**
- Fresh perspective = willing to change vendors
- Mandate to show value = looking for quick wins
- Transition period = reviewing all existing relationships

---

### 2. 10K Filings (Public Companies)
- Annual financial disclosures (property holdings listed)
- Recent property acquisitions (new tax exposure)
- Expansion announcements (new facilities = new tax considerations)

**Why this works:**
- Public data = easy to identify
- Property changes = need for tax expertise
- Filings happen on schedule = predictable outreach timing

---

### 3. Third-Party Intent (ZoomInfo)
Companies searching:
- "Property tax"
- "Business personal property tax"
- "Compliance"
- "Property tax services"

**⚠️ Limitation:** IP-level data (can't identify WHO searched)

**How to use it:**
- Company-level signal (intent exists)
- Layer with job change data (identify decision-maker)
- Priority score: Intent + new CFO = high priority

---

### 4. Website Visitors (First-Party)
- Companies visiting IVS website
- Specific pages viewed (case studies, services, contact)
- Repeat visitors (higher intent)

**Why this works:**
- First-party data (no IP-level ambiguity)
- Behavioral signal (actively researching)
- Can identify company (if using tracking tools)

---

## Value Proposition (IVS to Clients)

### Core Differentiators
1. **On-site visits** (vs. desktop-only competitors)
   - Physical property inspection
   - Accurate valuations (not guesstimates)

2. **Corporate-style service**
   - Always 2 people familiar with account (no surprises)
   - Consistent team (relationship continuity)
   - Professional, reliable, predictable

3. **Industrial expertise** (26 years in vertical)
   - Understand complex industrial property valuations
   - Relationships with assessors in industrial zones
   - Track record in vertical

### Pricing Model
- Based on property value
- Potential 10-15% tax reduction
- Typical engagement: $350/hour base rate
- Factors: Travel costs, number of properties, geographic spread, complexity

### Average Deal Size
- **$50K** per contract (IVS average)
- Range: $10K (small) → $200K+ (Fortune 500, multi-property)

---

## Buying Window (Seasonal)

### Critical Timeline
- **Bidding season:** Late summer → November
- **Contract signing deadline:** January (for next tax year)
- **Service delivery:** Throughout tax year (assessments, appeals, etc.)

### Urgency Curve
- **July-August:** Early (low urgency, best time to start outreach)
- **September-October:** Peak urgency (bidding window open, need to decide)
- **November:** Late urgency (compressed timeline, fast decisions)
- **December-January:** Contract finalization (if already engaged)
- **February+:** Too late for current tax year (wait until next July)

**Implication:**
- Prospect in **July-September** (early engagement)
- Close in **October-November** (peak urgency)
- Miss November = wait 9 months

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Desktop-Only Competitors
- Don't do on-site visits
- Lower service quality (remote valuations)
- Lower price point (volume-based)

**IVS Differentiation:** On-site visits, higher quality, premium pricing

### Other On-Site Providers
- Similar service model
- Compete on relationships, track record, pricing

**IVS Differentiation:** 26 years in business, industrial expertise, corporate service model

---

## ICP Validation Questions (Discovery)

Use these questions to qualify if prospect fits IVS ICP:

### 1. Industry Fit
> "What industry are you in? What type of properties do you own (manufacturing facilities, warehouses, refineries, etc.)?"

**✅ Fit:** Industrial (refineries, oil & gas, pulp/paper, chemical, food/beverage)
**❌ No fit:** Residential, retail, office space (not IVS's focus)

---

### 2. Property Holdings
> "How many properties do you own/operate? What's the total assessed value (if you know)?"

**✅ Fit:** Multiple properties, high assessed value (significant tax exposure)
**❌ No fit:** Single small property, low value (not worth IVS's service)

---

### 3. Current Approach
> "Do you currently work with a property tax consultant? How's that relationship going?"

**✅ Fit:** Using consultant (budget exists) but dissatisfied OR no consultant (opportunity)
**❌ No fit:** Happy with current consultant, long-term contract (no buying window)

---

### 4. Decision-Maker
> "Who typically makes decisions on property tax consulting? CFO, tax manager, someone else?"

**✅ Fit:** Speaking with CFO/tax manager OR can get access
**❌ No fit:** Speaking with junior person, no access to decision-maker

---

### 5. Timeline
> "When does your property tax bidding typically happen? What's your timeline for making a decision?"

**✅ Fit:** In bidding window (July-November) OR planning for next year
**❌ No fit:** Just signed multi-year contract, no near-term need

---

### 6. Budget Authority
> "What's your typical annual spend on property tax consulting? Who controls that budget?"

**✅ Fit:** Budget exists ($10K+ annually) + has authority or access to decision-maker
**❌ No fit:** No budget, no authority, no path to decision

---

## Pattern Status

**Validation Count:** 1 client (IVS Tax Services only)

**Status:** Client-specific (DO NOT GENERALIZE)

**Why not generalizable:**
- Property tax consulting is niche vertical
- Industrial focus is IVS-specific
- Other clients will have different ICPs (different industries, verticals, personas)

**What IS generalizable:**
- Professional services seasonal urgency (see separate pattern)
- B2B services ICP structure (industries, personas, intent signals)
- Intent-based targeting methodology (job changes, filings, website visitors)

---
