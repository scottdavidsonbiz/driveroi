# Meeting Insights: Miguel - Sales Planning & Territories

## Executive Summary
Scott conducted a formal kickoff with IVS partners Jeffrey and Jennifer Cohen to walk through the project approach, homework assignments, and contract. The call focused on defining ICPs, value propositions, and intent signals. Partners need to review the agreement and discuss internally (including with James who is traveling), with a decision expected early the following week while they're together in Fort Worth.

## Key Insights
- **IVS Positioning**: Specialize in industrial properties with corporate-style service; "buddy truck" mentality (always 2 people know each account).
- **Competitive Landscape**: Big 4 firms (Ryan, KPMG, Deloitte) dominating with full-service tax offerings; smaller boutique firms like IVS competing on specialization.
- **Client Retention**: Majority of clients stay 5+ years, though Jennifer notes they forget about short-term clients who churned.
- **Federal GTM**: Scott's mom (expert in federal sales/FedRAMP) could be resource if IVS wants to pursue government contracts.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Differentiation Challenge**: IVS struggles to articulate competitive advantage beyond "we do industrial" and "we're attentive."
- **Current Marketer Issues**: Sends overly long emails that partners have to pre-approve; uses AI that creates problematic or misleading language.
- **CRM Limitations**: Using Zoom Info with intent tracking but unclear if premium LinkedIn is providing value; looking to optimize spend.
- **Time Constraints**: Partners have limited bandwidth to explain industry nuances; need solution that doesn't require extensive handholding.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Jeffrey/Jennifer**: Complete homework - ICP definition, win rate analysis by segment, value proposition ranking, case studies (1-2 per industry).
- [ ] **Jeffrey/Jennifer**: Review agreement over weekend in Fort Worth (Sunday-Tuesday); discuss with James.
- [ ] **Jeffrey/Jennifer**: Provide decision early following week on whether to proceed.
- [ ] **Scott**: Send agreement and kickoff deck materials.
- [ ] **Scott**: Research LinkedIn Premium necessity for automation tools.

- **Meeting Date**: Monday, November 14 (following up from November 3 proposal review; James not present).
