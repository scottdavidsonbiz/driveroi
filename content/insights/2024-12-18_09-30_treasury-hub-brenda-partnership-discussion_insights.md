# Treasury Hub Proposal + Brenda Partnership Discussion - Key Insights

**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Participants:** Scott, Brenda, Marcos (Treasury Hub)
**Type:** Partnership discussion + client proposal call

---

## Part 1: Brenda Partnership Clarification (Before Marcos Joins)

### Key Quotes from Brenda

**On Clay/Demand Gen:**
> "For me, Clay is just another tool, right? Like it could be Excel... I don't know how much effort, I don't know what is even possible, like the result that system has... I need to understand the Clay universe."

**On Partnership Structure:**
> "We can go like different ways. One is if we both recommend [working together], we definitely take it. I need to understand the Clay universe... and then probably you need to take something like revenue architecture... so we can talk about volumetrics."

**Acknowledging Overlap:**
> "I definitely don't want you to feel like you're building an implementation... if it's more like an agency then the tool doesn't matter... the tool is like a computer, like Excel."

### Insights on Partnership Dynamics

1. **Brenda doesn't understand Clay's strategic value** - She sees it as "just another tool like Excel" vs. understanding it as a competitive moat/specialized capability

2. **She's proposing skill swap** - She learns Clay, Scott learns "revenue architecture" to talk about "volumetrics" (her analytics language)

3. **She acknowledges you're building capabilities** - Recognizes Scott is investing in Clay expertise she doesn't have

4. **Open to different partnership structures** - Not rigid, willing to discuss horizontal (service type) vs. vertical (functional) splits

### What This Reveals

**Brenda's Perspective:**
- Doesn't see Clay as strategic differentiator (just tactical execution tool)
- Wants to learn it to be able to "sell it better"
- Thinks partnership requires both having same knowledge
- Not bringing unique demand gen capability to table

**Partnership Misalignment:**
- She wants to LEARN what you're ALREADY BUILDING
- This confirms: for demand gen, she doesn't add unique value you lack
- Her real value (analytics/RevOps) isn't what she's proposing to partner on

## Part 2: Treasury Hub (Marcos) Proposal Discussion

### Client Context

**Company:** Treasury Hub
**Industry:** Fintech (treasury/cash management software)
**Stage:** International expansion (LatAm/Africa → needs revenue growth)
**Current State:** Has product, needs systematic outbound engine

### Key Requirements

**Target ICP - Technographic:**
- Companies using **NetSuite ERP** (primary filter)
- Size: Mid-market (based on $20K ACV)
- Geography: **Mexico and Ghana** (priority markets for pilot)
- Industries: Any industry using NetSuite

**Pricing:**
- Average Contract Value (ACV): **$20K/year**
- Pricing model: Annual contracts
- Mexico: Slightly higher ACV potential
- West Africa (Ghana): Potentially lower ACV

**Timeline:**
- Start: January 2025 (ideally)
- Realistic: Jan 12-26, 2025 (post-holiday)
- Willing to do prep work in December

**Budget Constraints:**
- Previously indicated low budget (Marcos acknowledged "budget might be too low")
- Wants tiered proposal to compare options
- Interested in pilot approach (3 months) to test before full commitment

### Marcos's Needs

**What He's Looking For:**
> "I was not expecting two products that get consumed within a few days... what I really need is to build a system first and then execute it."

**Clarity Request:**
> "Please share that with me... like three different plans... for this budget, this is what we can do; for this other budget, this is what we can do. So it's like two different plans or three different plans."

**Specific Clay Deliverables:**
> "If you can be specific in terms of at least what you will include... with Clay you can do anything... what you're particularly thinking of in terms of the first few months, the basics, and then how you see it evolving."

### What Marcos Wants to Understand

1. **Tiered pricing options** - Low budget vs. higher budget, what's included/excluded
2. **Clay specifics** - Not just "we'll use Clay," but what workflows/tables/enrichments exactly
3. **Build vs. execution split** - What you do vs. what he does at each price point
4. **Pilot structure** - 3-month test focused on one ICP hypothesis (NetSuite + Mexico/Ghana)
5. **Evolution path** - How does the system expand over time

## Scott's Proposed Approach

### Two-Tier Model

**TIER 1: Low Budget (~$2K/month) - "Guided Build"**
- Limit to **10 hours/month** of Scott's involvement
- **Deliverables:**
  - Set up ONE hypothesis/ICP (NetSuite + Mexico/Ghana)
  - Create documentation and screen recordings
  - Set up frameworks and templates
  - Show Marcos how to implement
- **Marcos does:** Actual execution, copywriting, testing, iteration
- **Scott does:** Strategy, setup guidance, async Q&A, recommendations
- **Model:** "We build the first one together, you replicate the rest"

**TIER 2: Higher Budget ($4K-5K/month) - "Full Build + Execution"**
- **Deliverables:**
  - Set up ALL ICP hypotheses (all intent signals, all segments)
  - End-to-end Clay table setup
  - Instantly.ai infrastructure and sequences
  - Domain setup and warming
  - Full execution
- **Scott does:** Everything - build and run
- **Marcos does:** Provide feedback, review results
- **Model:** "Build → Run → Prove → Handoff"

### Iteration Approach (Lower Budget)

**Month 1:**
- Set up one account list
- Show how to purchase domains and warm them
- Marcos implements

**Month 2:**
- Review stats from first campaign
- Provide copy recommendations and resources
- Marcos tests and iterates

**Month 3+:**
- Add new hypotheses (e.g., Sage Intacct + Kenya)
- Template approach: 30-60 minutes to set up new table
- Continue iteration based on results

### Key Quote from Scott

On hypothesis testing:
> "Each set of campaigns is testing a hypothesis... NetSuite in Nigeria and Mexico... you would be able to... go to the next hypothesis, which might be they have Sage Intacct and they're in Kenya... That would take me 30 minutes to an hour... we set up one or two primary hypotheses and then we iterate over time."

## Strategic Insights

### 1. Marcos Validates "Build → Run → Prove" Need

Marcos explicitly doesn't want:
- "Two products that get consumed within a few days"
- Quick deliverables with no ongoing support

He explicitly wants:
- "Build a system first and then execute it"
- Ongoing partnership, not one-off delivery

**This validates the Build → Run → Prove → Handoff positioning.**

### 2. International Client Budget Reality

**Pattern Emerging:**
- International clients (Marcos in Spain serving LatAm/Africa) have tighter budgets than US clients
- They want premium expertise but at non-US pricing
- They're budget-sensitive but value-focused

**Implication for Positioning:**
- International segment may need different pricing tier
- "Guided build" model (lower touch) fits their budget constraints
- Can still deliver value without full hands-on execution

### 3. Tiered Pricing Solves Budget Objections

**Instead of:** "Your budget is too low, here's a referral"
**Better:** "Here are 2-3 options at different price points, pick what fits"

**Benefits:**
- Doesn't lose client due to price
- Client chooses their own engagement level
- Can upsell from Tier 1 → Tier 2 after seeing results
- Respects budget constraints while maintaining value

### 4. ICP Specificity Enables Better Proposals

**Marcos provided:**
- Technographic: NetSuite ERP users
- Geographic: Mexico, Ghana
- ACV: $20K/year
- Pilot focus: 3 months on one hypothesis

**This specificity allows:**
- Concrete scope definition
- Accurate time estimates
- Clear deliverable expectations
- Pilot → Scale path

### 5. "Pilot" Approach De-Risks for Both Sides

**Brenda's question about prioritization** opened door to:
- 3-month pilot on specific segment
- Prove results before full commitment
- Learn the ICP together through testing
- Build trust before expanding scope

**This is smart positioning** - doesn't require full annual commitment upfront.

## Connections to Existing Knowledge

### Validates

1. **Build → Run → Prove → Handoff model** (positioning-premium-partnership-2024-12-16.md)
   - Marcos explicitly wants this vs. consumable deliverables

2. **International segment needs** (us-market-entry positioning)
   - Treasury Hub: LatAm/Africa company needing systematic outbound
   - Budget constraints but high value on expertise

3. **Tiered pricing necessity** (not yet documented)
   - Can't have single price point for all clients
   - Need Guided Build vs. Full Service tiers

### Refines

1. **Partnership positioning with Brenda** (client-feedback/brenda-partnership-scope-clarification-2024-12-17.md)
   - Brenda's comments confirm: she doesn't bring unique demand gen value
   - She wants to LEARN what Scott is BUILDING
   - Partnership doesn't make sense for demand gen specifically

2. **International client pricing** (not yet documented)
   - May need separate tier for international clients
   - $2K-3K/month "Guided Build" vs. $6K-12K "Full Service"

### New Patterns

1. **Technographic targeting** (NetSuite, Sage Intacct, etc.)
   - Fintech companies often target by ERP system
   - Strong signal for treasury/finance software
   - Can be primary ICP filter in Clay

2. **Pilot → Scale approach**
   - Start with ONE hypothesis (3 months)
   - Prove results on focused segment
   - Expand to additional hypotheses after validation
   - De-risks client commitment

3. **Geographic expansion specificity**
   - Not just "international expansion"
   - Specific countries: Mexico, Ghana, Kenya
   - Allows for testing market-by-market

## Key Quotes

**Marcos on what he needs:**
> "I was not expecting two products that get consumed within a few days... what I really need is to build a system first and then execute it."

**Marcos on budget clarity:**
> "I understand that budget might be too low for you... please share... two different plans or three different plans... for this budget, this is what we can do."

**Brenda on Clay:**
> "For me, Clay is just another tool, right? Like it could be Excel... I need to understand the Clay universe."

**Scott on tiered approach:**
> "With a larger budget, we set them all up at once and run them concurrently. If we did it all at once, it would be many, many hours. But if we set up one or two, iterate upon it, and continue to add them over time, it's a little easier for us to handle."

## Next Steps

1. **Create Treasury Hub proposal** (by Friday)
2. **Partnership decision with Brenda** (Friday meeting)
3. **Update positioning docs** based on learnings
4. **Document tiered pricing model** for future clients
