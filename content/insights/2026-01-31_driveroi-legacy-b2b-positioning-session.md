# DriveROI Legacy B2B Positioning Session

**Date:** January 31, 2026

## Strategic Decision: Direct to Companies First

**Key insight:** Not targeting PE/VC initially. Going direct to legacy B2B companies to test offers and messaging before pursuing intermediaries.

**Rationale:**
- Faster feedback loops
- Can test volume quickly (1,000 accounts per offer)
- Build case studies before approaching PE firms

---

## Target Segment: Legacy B2B Companies

**Profile:**
- 15-100 employees
- $5M-$100M revenue
- 5-25 years in business
- Founder-led or small leadership team
- Using manual/outdated GTM processes

**Key characteristic:** Companies that have outgrown doing things manually but aren't ready for full-time hires to fix it.

---

## Offer Testing Framework

Testing 3 offers with the same persona + 1 signal-based campaign:

### Offer 1: Free Targeting Review
- **Hook:** "Do you know which types of companies close fastest?"
- **Value prop:** 20 minutes to show who to prioritize and why
- **CTA:** Low commitment, free review

### Offer 2: Get Organized 90 Days
- **Hook:** "If your top salesperson left tomorrow, could someone else pick up where they left off?"
- **Value prop:** 90 days to document what's working and make it repeatable
- **CTA:** Worth a conversation?

### Offer 3: Build and Run
- **Hook:** "How much of your week goes to finding new opportunities vs. actually selling?"
- **Value prop:** We handle the finding part. Build and run outreach.
- **CTA:** Worth a conversation?

### Signal-Based: RevOps Hiring Trigger
- **Hook:** "Saw you're hiring" / "Your ops hire"
- **Value prop:** Get foundation in place before new hire starts
- **Timing:** Triggered by job postings for sales ops/RevOps roles

## Symptom-Based Messaging Approach

**Core principle:** Surface problems they're not actively thinking about through questions they can't easily answer.

**Why this works:**
- No active buying signal = need to create awareness of problem
- Questions that require thought make prospects stop and reflect
- Avoids the "I'm fine" default response

**Effective symptom-based questions:**
- "If your top salesperson left tomorrow, could someone else pick up where they left off?"
- "Do you know which types of companies close fastest for [company]?"
- "How much of your week goes to finding new opportunities vs. actually selling?"
- "If I asked why your best customers bought, would the answer be clear?"

**What makes a good symptom question:**
1. They can't answer it immediately with "yes" or "no"
2. The honest answer reveals a gap
3. It's relevant to their day-to-day (not abstract)

## Email Copy Guidelines

### Keep it under 100 words
All campaign emails were trimmed to under 100 words. Shorter = easier to read, faster to respond.

### Use elementary language
- No jargon ("GTM", "RevOps", "pipeline")
- Simple, direct sentences
- Write like you're explaining to a friend

### Structure: Poke the Bear
1. **Question** that surfaces a problem
2. **Brief context** on what you do
3. **Simple CTA** (low friction)

### Example (Free Targeting Review - Variant A):
> {{firstName}},
>
> Do you know which types of companies close fastest for {{companyName}}? Or does every deal feel different?
>
> I do targeting reviews for B2B companies. 20 minutes to show you who I'd prioritize and why.
>
> Worth a look?
>
> {{sendingAccountFirstName}}

## Key Differentiator: Execution AND Strategy

DriveROI does both execution and strategy. This is the differentiator vs. consultants (strategy only) or agencies (execution only).

**Positioning statement:** "We help founders build sales systems that work without them. Nothing fancy. Just clarity on what works."

1. Load 1,000 accounts per offer campaign
2. Monitor response rates by offer
3. Use winning offer to inform positioning refinement
4. Build case studies from early wins before approaching PE firms
