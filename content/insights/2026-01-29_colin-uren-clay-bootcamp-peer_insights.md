# Colin Uren - Clay Bootcamp Peer Sync

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Context:** Clay bootcamp peer connection - similar ICP (industrial/construction)
**Location:** Colin is in Paraguay (Canadian, moved 2 months ago)

---

## Colin's Background

- B2B tech sales background (started 2022, 3-month bootcamp for cold calling/email)
- Worked as SDR at Toronto company
- Now working with his father's software startup (3 people total)

**Company:** Project controls software for large capital projects
- Mac/iOS native only (limitation - industry uses Windows/P6/Microsoft Project)
- Focusing on services first, software later
- Doing "schedule audits" - import project schedules, identify missing dependencies/durations/critical path

**Target Market:** Construction of things - oil & gas commissioning, real estate, infrastructure
- Working with commissioning consultant group in oil & gas
- Have worked with smaller developers (100-unit apartment buildings)

---

## Current Challenges

1. **No established GTM motion** - "fly by the skin of our teeth"
2. **All manual outreach** - no Sales Navigator, no Apollo
3. **Father (72) is slow to adopt** - resistant to spending on marketing
4. **Changed direction multiple times** - three CRMs in past year
5. **Can't sell software yet** - not built out enough, selling services first
6. **Organic inbound only** - LinkedIn posts, nothing systematic

---

## Overlap with DriveROI

### Similar Target Market
- Industrial companies with $10M+ assets
- Construction/infrastructure
- Multi-location operations

### Potential Synergies
- Colin's father has 18,000 LinkedIn connections (potential scrape/activate)
- Could share lists (oil & gas, construction companies)
- Similar learning curve with Clay/automation

### Tools Discussed
- **Manus (manus.bio):** Colin used for project schedule generation - most accurate of AI tools tested
- **Perplexity:** Both use for research
- **Apify:** LinkedIn scraping
- **Phantom Buster:** Follower/connection scraping
