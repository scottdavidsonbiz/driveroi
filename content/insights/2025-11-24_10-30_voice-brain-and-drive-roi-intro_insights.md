# Meeting Insights: Discovery Call - Scott Davidson & Keegan Burchard (Voice Brain)

## Executive Summary
Keegan Burchard (VP of GTM at Voice Brain) discussed his company's AI radio transcription platform for public safety agencies and federal entities. Voice Brain recently secured CRADA agreements with Coast Guard and TSA but lacks sophisticated GTM infrastructure. Keegan is exploring Clay and automation tools to streamline manual research of federal contracts and public safety RFPs, but needs clarity on company direction (federal vs. state/local focus) before committing to implementation.

## Key Insights
- **Voice Brain Product**: AI transcription, alerting, and search for radio communications used by police, fire, airports, sheriff's offices.
- **Recent Win**: CRADA agreements with Coast Guard (signing Wednesday) and TSA - no money initially but huge validation for pursuing federal market.
- **Current GTM**: Very manual - Keegan is SDR/AE/AM doing everything; calling police chiefs, using Clarify CRM, lapsed Zoom Info subscription.
- **Clay Misconception**: Keegan thinks Clay is expensive but hasn't explored BYOK (bring your own keys) approach which is much cheaper.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Bandwidth Crunch**: Small team, Keegan wearing all hats; can't scale current manual calling approach.
- **Strategic Uncertainty**: Need to decide between federal focus (requires FedRAMP, longer sales cycles) vs. state/local (faster but fewer resources).
- **Contract Research**: Missing RFP opportunities - finding contracts after due dates passed; need automated monitoring of public purchase sites.
- **Tool Stack**: Clarify CRM (likes it), Zoom Info (lapsed, looking at Apollo or Xa as alternatives), no sequencing until Clarify releases theirs in ~3 months.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Scott**: Create loom video demo showing Clay workflow for GTM engineer job alerts by end of day Wednesday.
- [ ] **Keegan**: Discuss with Tony (CEO) to determine strategic direction (federal vs. state/local) by end of next week.
- [ ] **Keegan**: Schedule follow-up call with Scott and Tony week of December 15 (any time except 12-1pm ET).
- [ ] **Scott**: Demonstrate how Clay can scrape public purchase sites, federal contract databases, and create automated alerts.

## Context & Details
- **Participants**: Scott Davidson (Consultant), Keegan Burchard (VP GTM at Voice Brain).
- **Companies**:
    - **Voice Brain**: Early-stage public safety tech, merged 2 months ago, small distributed team (Boston, Bay Area, Texas, Philly).
    - **Referral**: Scott's mom (Tony's former colleague) introduced them; she's advising on federal sales strategy.
- **Tools Discussed**: Clay, Clarify CRM, Zoom Info, Apollo, Xa (data providers), instantly.ai, public purchase.com (contract aggregator).
- **Pricing Insight**: Clay at $350/month + BYOK much cheaper than using native credits; instantly.ai at $500/year with good verification.
