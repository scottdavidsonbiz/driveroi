# Meeting Insights: Discovery Call - Scott Davidson & Gautier Mary-Dauphin

## Executive Summary
Scott Davidson and Gautier Mary-Dauphin discussed Gautier's current role helping a friend's early-stage startup (5 employees) scale its Go-To-Market (GTM) operations. Gautier is seeking advice on setting up pipeline generation, ICP definition, and data enrichment. Scott shared his background in RevOps and GTM finance (formerly 6sense) and outlined his consultative approach to supporting startups. They agreed to reconnect in Q1 as Gautier's team scales and hiring begins.

## Key Insights
- **Gautier's Situation**: Acting as a fractional/interim Ops/GTM lead for a small environmental data startup (5 employees, targeting 20 in 12 months).
- **Scott's Positioning**: Positioning himself as a consultative systems integrator for RevOps/GTM, focusing on bespoke strategy rather than productized lead gen.
- **Startup Business Model**: B2B2B. Selling environmental/deforestation data to platforms (e.g., Bloomberg) who resell to end consumers (financial institutions, governments).
- **Channel Challenge**: The platforms (channel partners) need help selling the solution to the end customer; the startup may need to deploy capacity to enable these partners.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Lack of GTM Expertise**: Gautier has a strong finance background but finds pipeline generation, ICP outreach, and data enrichment "blurry" and needs support there.
- **Resource Constraints**: Currently a team of one in Ops; need to automate enrichment to save manual work for future SDRs/reps.
- **Channel Partner Enablement**: Partners need incentivization and support to sell the data product effectively to end users.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Gautier**: Continue setting up HubSpot and initial tactics in December.
- [ ] **Gautier**: Reassess need for external support in Q1 when hiring full-time sales staff.
- [ ] **Scott**: Keep in touch for potential Q1 collaboration.
- [ ] **Scott**: (Offer) Connect Gautier with his mother regarding federal sales/FedRAMP if needed.
- [ ] **General**: Discuss support for "Sarah" and "Meshly" (RevRec issue) in the future.

- **Companies**:
    - **Scott**: Starting a new GTM consulting business.
