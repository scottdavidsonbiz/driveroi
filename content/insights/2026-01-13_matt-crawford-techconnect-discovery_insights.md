# Matt Crawford - TechConnect Field Services Discovery Call

**Date:** January 13, 2026
**Company:** TechConnect (Field Services)
**Location:** North Carolina (HQ)
**Outcome:** Lost - Ghosting after discovery call

---

## Company Overview

**Business Model:** Field services company bridging remote teams and nationwide physical locations
- Break/fix field service work (90% of revenue)
- Staff augmentation (10%, want to grow)
- ~15 W-2 employees, primarily use subcontractors for field work
- National coverage through contractor network

**Key Differentiator:** Single point of contact for multi-location companies. They coordinate field technicians nationwide, provide consistent pricing, and deliver exceptional communication (constant updates via text/email that customers love).

**Target Customers:**
- Companies with 50+ locations spread geographically
- MSPs without field service capabilities
- IT departments with 300+ locations needing on-prem support
- QSR chains (Quick Service Restaurants) - emerging focus

**Tech Stack:** Zoho (CRM, Books, Desk, Click, Sign), G Suite, considering ServiceNow

---

## Current State & Pain Points

### Previous Outbound Experience (Failed)
- Hired third-party for email marketing
- Promised 20 appointments/month, delivered 0-2
- **Core problem:** Agency bought cheap leads that didn't match ICP
- Got single-site locations when they need 50+ locations
- Agency didn't understand their unique value proposition
- Had 50 domains set up, proper sending limits (15/day), used SmartLead
- Foundation was good, lead quality was terrible

### What They Need
1. Email marketing that actually understands their ICP
2. LinkedIn outreach
3. A/B testing to find what works
4. Website improvements (acknowledged it's terrible)
5. LinkedIn profile optimization
6. The whole funnel working together

### Sales Cycle
- 90-180 days typical
- Trust-based sale - customers need to experience service quality
- Long nurture required (one prospect since June, still working)
- Once customers try them, they're hooked ("Matt, you're amazing")

### Deal Sizes
- Average ticket: $200-300 (2-hour job)
- Volume varies by customer size (5-10 tickets/day per customer)
- Project work: $60K+ for multi-site deployments
- Upsell opportunities: cameras, phone systems (Dialpad), network stacks (Ubiquiti)

---

## Key Opportunities Mentioned

### Active Prospects (at time of call)
- 350 location warehouse company - brake fix + camera project + Dialpad interest
- 1,000 location company - interested in ServiceNow integration
- 100 location QSR - opening 25 stores/year, turnkey opportunity

### Expansion Potential
- QSR market is huge - tons of new brands opening/closing
- Once in with break/fix, upsell to cameras, phones, network
- Single customer can become multi-hundred-thousand dollar relationship

---

## Call Dynamics

### What Worked
- Initial email demonstrated ICP understanding (he noted targets were "within our ICP")
- He felt we were "already a step ahead" from the research
- Open to performance-based component in pricing

### What Didn't Work
- Email came from "Steven" (sending account) - slight disconnect
- Positioning as "systems and processes" confused him
- Asked "are you guys not doing the email marketing?" after Brenda's explanation
- No clear pricing provided when asked
- No concrete next steps or timeline

### His Expectations
- Budget exists but wants to start small and scale with results
- Wants a strategic partner to grow with
- Open to monthly retainer + performance bonus structure
- Needs to see trajectory improvement over 90-180 days
- Values transparency and expertise

---

## ICP Criteria (for targeting)

**Must Have:**
- 50+ locations
- Spread across multiple states/geographic regions
- Remote IT support model (help desk)
- Industries: MSPs, QSRs, retail chains, warehouse/logistics, any multi-location business

**Sweet Spots:**
- MSPs without field service capabilities
- Companies growing fast (opening new locations)
- Companies that just acquired another company (inheriting IT chaos)
- Companies using ServiceNow (familiar integration)

**Disqualifying:**
- Single-site locations
- All locations in one metro (can use local vendor)
- Companies that already have field service partner

---

## Lessons Learned (Post-Mortem)

### Why Deal Was Lost

1. **Initial targeting misalignment** - Email referenced BDR hiring (staff augmentation) which is only 10% of their business, not their priority

2. **Positioning confusion** - Presented as "revenue operations" and "systems/data/processes" when he wanted straightforward email marketing execution

3. **No pricing clarity** - Asked multiple times about pricing, received vague answers about "minimum 3 months" and "no guarantees"

4. **Didn't address core concern** - His #1 fear was getting burned again with cheap leads. Needed to explicitly explain lead sourcing methodology

5. **Too much strategy, not enough execution** - "Strategy first, look at your CRM" when he wanted someone to just execute well

6. **No urgency or concrete next steps** - Call ended with "we'll send a proposal" but no specific timeline or commitment

### What Should Have Been Different

1. **Pre-call:** Research actual business model (field services, not staffing)
2. **Lead with execution:** "We do email marketing. Here's exactly how we'd target 50+ location companies."
3. **Give pricing range early:** "Typically $X-Y/month for this scope"
4. **Address the fear directly:** "Your last agency bought cheap leads. Here's specifically how we source and verify ICP fit before any email sends."
5. **Offer small pilot:** "Let's do a 2-week paid test - 200 leads matching your ICP, you see the quality before committing"
6. **Send sample list:** 25 companies matching his ICP to prove understanding
