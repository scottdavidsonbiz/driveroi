# Bryan Ilg - Deployed Dynamic MDF Strategy

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**Company:** Deployed Dynamic
**Status:** Nurturing - waiting on MDF funding approval
**Next Meeting:** February 11, 2026

---

## Business Overview

**What They Do:** Channel partner selling telecom/connectivity services
- Sells for all major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Xfinity, Starlink)
- Primary focus: Business internet (primary connections)
- Secondary: Failover internet, 5G connections
- Also sells hardware (routers from OEMs like Peplink, Catalyst)

**Unique Position:** Carrier-agnostic - can quote all providers, let customer choose best option

**Platform:** Channel OS - ordering portal that will evolve into self-service for end customers

---

## Target Market

**Profile:**
- SMB service businesses
- 5-50 employees
- Need internet connectivity

**Key Insight from Bryan:** This is a TIMING sale, not a profile sale
- Everyone needs internet
- Challenge is catching them at the right moment

**Buying Triggers (High Intent):**
1. **Starting a business** - LLC formation (strongest signal)
2. **Opening new location** - moving from home to brick & mortar
3. **Moving business** - point A to point B
4. **Adding new line of revenue** - expansion
5. **Buying a sign** - indicator of new establishment

---

## MDF (Market Development Funds) Opportunity

**Strategy:** Use carrier MDF to fund demand gen campaigns

**Bryan's Pitch to Carriers:**
"You want partners generating business. We're making this investment in demand gen. Help us get off the ground."

**Current Status:**
- Meeting with OEM marketing people (Friday after call)
- Got MDF rules from one router OEM
- Working AT&T relationship (has leverage - "darling" status)
- Second AT&T team meeting scheduled

**Budget Target:** ~$30K in MDF funding

---

## Market Intelligence

### Carrier Quotas (AT&T Example)
- Sales manager has 8-16 reps
- Team quota: ~5 fixed wireless activations per rep
- Total: ~40-100 activations per team per month
- Similar quotas across Verizon, T-Mobile, Xfinity

### Market Size (Richmond Example)
- Estimated 500-700 new line activations per month across all carriers
- If DriveROI helps capture 10% = fills entire team's quota

### Competitive Landscape
- **Connected Solutions Group** (Richmond) - does 20K activations/month with Verizon
- They CANNOT generate their own leads - 90%+ is inbound from Verizon
- Don't know how to sell back into their own customer base
- "Sitting on a gold mine and they're just kind of dumb"

---

## Opportunity Structure

### Phase 1: Prove the Model
1. Set up LLC formation trigger (always-on)
2. Filter for service businesses with physical locations
3. Email outreach → drive to form/website → get quotes

### Phase 2: Flywheel
- Use wins to get more MDF from carriers
- Compete markets against each other for investment
- Scale across AT&T, then Verizon, then others

### Phase 3: Productize
- White-label capability for other telco partners
- Bryan: "If we can figure this out, lots of people will want to know how"
- Potential intro to Connected Solutions Group

## Key Quotes

> "This is more of a timing sale than a specific profile. Everybody needs Internet."

> "My former company... they literally cannot generate their own leads. Almost 90-something percent is just inbound traffic from Verizon."

> "If we can sort it out then it puts me out in front of a lot of people and then there's gonna be a lot of people want to know how I do it."

## Data Sources Discussed

1. **LLC Formation:** Can set up always-on trigger
2. **Commercial Real Estate:** CoStar for lease signings, new developments
3. **42 Spaces:** Office leasing specific
4. **Sign Companies:** Partnership opportunity (Fast Signs example - cousin works there)

---

## Next Steps

- Bryan selling the vision to AT&T and OEMs for MDF
- Meeting February 11 to check progress
- If funded, build LLC formation trigger campaign
- Potential white-label arrangement
- Bryan offered to refer DriveROI to his network (AI Ready RVA event, product people)
