# GTM Infrastructure 3-Month Setup Framework

**Source:** Stellar Growth (YouTube)  
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNlB_fgC2Hg  
**Date Analyzed:** December 17, 2024  
**Use Case:** Understanding competitive service delivery models

---

## Executive Summary

A GTM infrastructure agency explains their evolved service model: **moving from "doing outbound for clients" to "building sustainable infrastructure."** Key insight: **Doing it yourself (10-20 BDRs sending for clients) doesn't work for horizontal software** due to territory conflicts with AEs. Instead, they now set up **3-month infrastructure engagements** focused on systems that clients can own and operate.

**Critical takeaway:** The bottleneck is never technical - it's always **discovery, expectation setting, and teaching the client.**

---

## Three-Month Framework Structure

### MONTH 1: Discovery & Audit (Foundation Phase)

**Goals:**
- Understand the business deeply
- Set realistic expectations
- Audit existing systems
- Reserve email infrastructure (30-day warmup starts)

**Key Activities:**

#### 1. Expectation Setting ⭐ *Most Important*
- **Timeline reality check:** "We're not expecting pipeline in first 30 days"
- **Common timeline:** 2-6 months to see consistent pipeline
- **Best case story:** Company took 9 months to crack outbound, then made millions
- **Messaging:** "You didn't crack ads in month 1. Outbound takes iteration too."

**Why this matters:**
> "Sales wants full calendars. Leadership wants ROI on their investment. This is the toughest part of any engagement."

#### 2. Team Structure Evaluation
- **Question:** "Who will own this after we leave?"
- **Design principle:** Build for the people who will maintain it
- **Avoid:** Complex one-off campaigns requiring deep technical knowledge
- **Goal:** Nothing breaks randomly after 6 months

#### 3. CRM & Past Efforts Audit
- Review all past campaigns
- Check CRM data quality and contact count
- **Example issue found:** "Gong calls disconnected for 3 years, had to manually associate"
- Understand target addressable market (TAM) size
- **AI usage:** Review sales calls manually, not just feeding to AI

#### 4. Email Infrastructure Setup (Critical)
- **30-day warmup period required** - non-negotiable
- **Purpose 1:** Finalize what matters most
- **Purpose 2:** Avoid "virgin domain flags" from sending too soon
- **Alternative:** Can use generic infrastructure for urgent events (discouraged)

#### 5. Market Research Phase
- Segment verticals (especially for horizontal SaaS)
- Create ICP documentation from scratch or enhance existing
- **Process:** Review every best customer, all sales calls, churned customers
- **Tool:** Run through "context model" (AI analysis)
- **Output:** Foundation documents for all future campaigns

---

### MONTH 1-2: Infrastructure Setup (Intense Build Phase)

**Core Components Built:**

#### 1. Sending Infrastructure
- Email domains + inboxes
- LinkedIn accounts setup
- Warmup protocols

#### 2. Clay Tables & Enrichment
- Build enrichment workflows
- Deep qualification prompts ("holy grail prompt")
- Scoring systems (only if limited by team/channel capacity)

#### 3. HubSpot Automation
- Lead routing automations
- Positive reply handling
- Qualification checks on backend

#### 4. Signal Setup (Bottom-Up TAM Building)
**Critical signals to implement:**

- **Website visitor identification** (non-negotiable)
  - Multiply identified visitors by 2-5x for true reach
  - Enables attribution even if reply rates look bad
  - "At bare minimum, cold email is a private ads network"

- **Outbound sync**
  - Track: Are people you emailed coming in via other channels?
  - Saves campaigns that "failed" by reply rate but drove website traffic

- **ICP job changes & hires**
  - Monitor target companies for new hires in key roles

- **Niche-specific signals**
  - Example: Clinical trials.gov for non-institution trial sponsors
  - Custom per vertical

#### 5. TAM Mapping
- **Goal:** 80% of TAM, not 100%
- **Philosophy:** "People who aim for 100% are wasting time. 80/20 rule."
- **Process:** Best customers → verticals → prioritization
- **Timeline:** 12-month horizon for reaching 80% of TAM

#### 6. Campaign Prep (Parallel to above)

**Close-lost campaign:**
- Analyze sales calls and lost customers
- Prepare re-engagement sequences

**Social campaign:**
- Pull founder's LinkedIn followers/likes
- Analyze competitor followers
- Prepare targeted social outreach

**Inbound optimization:**
- Demo form abandoners
- Email opt-ins not being nurtured
- Follow-up sequence gaps

---

### MONTH 2-3: Launch & Iteration (Education Phase)

**Campaign Launch Strategy:**

#### 1. "Say Hello" to TAM Campaign
- **Purpose:** Let your market know you exist (especially startups)
- **Structure:** 2 emails max, then stop
- **Goal:** Not hyper-targeted initially - broad market awareness
- **Success metrics:**
  - Positive replies → interviews/feedback → route to sales
  - No reply → Stop after 2 emails (just saying hello)

#### 2. Add Company-Level TAM to CRM
- Enrich CRM with all research
- Use rubric developed together
- **Timeline:** 2-week process minimum

#### 3. Top-Down Signal Monitoring (Now that TAM is in CRM)
- Monitor TAM for new hires
- Track job changes at target companies
- Customer support hiring signals
- Create feedback loop: Add to TAM → Monitor TAM → Expand TAM

#### 4. LinkedIn Outreach (Later in timeline)
- **Note:** Companies are "more careful than they need to be"
- **Reality check:** "No one remembers a cold DM from 3 weeks ago"
- **Strategy:** Don't send to everyone at large company at once - bucket and sequence

#### 5. Bucketing & Prioritization
- Large companies with many good-fit contacts
- Segment and sequence outreach (don't blast everyone)
- Plan re-enrichment cycle (60-90 days for large CRMs)

#### 6. Lead Routing Setup
- Positive reply comes in
- Double-check qualification (recommend backend qualification for larger SaaS)
- Route properly
- Save in Clay table
- Update HubSpot
- Enrich phone numbers
- Push to Slack for BDRs

## Critical Philosophies & Insights

### 1. **Discovery Takes Time, But Saves More Time**
> "Companies want to start fast and skip discovery. It ends up making things take longer."

**Common issues found:**
- Gong calls disconnected for years
- CRM data quality disasters
- Misaligned expectations between sales and leadership
- Technical debt from quick fixes

### 2. **Teach, Don't Just Deliver**
> "We're going to leave at some point. Who is going to own these things going forward? That colors a lot of how we do this setup."

**Design principle:**
- Avoid one-off niche campaigns requiring insane technical knowledge
- Build systems the client can maintain
- Documentation and training baked into delivery

### 3. **Attribution > Reply Rates**
> "Campaigns that would have otherwise be considered a failure by reply rate were actually successful in driving traffic to the website."

**Why this matters:**
- Cold email is at minimum a "private ads network"
- Website visitor tracking (multiply by 2-5x) shows true reach
- Outbound sync shows cross-channel attribution
- Success ≠ just reply rates

### 4. **80/20 Rule for TAM**
> "We're not going to aim for 100% of your target area market in 12 months. It's just not feasible. People who spend time doing 100% are wasting their time."

**Practical approach:**
- Focus on best customers first
- Expand to look-alikes
- Accept that some TAM will be missed
- Better to have 80% coverage executing than 100% coverage stuck in analysis

### 5. **Expectation Management is Everything**
> "This is the toughest part of any engagement. Sales wants full calendars. Leadership wants ROI."

**Realistic timeline communicated upfront:**
- Month 1: Discovery only
- Month 2: Sending starts, pipeline generation *ideally* happens
- Reality: Can take up to 6 months
- Story: One company took 9 months, then made millions

### 6. **30-Day Domain Warmup is Non-Negotiable**
> "If you're sending from domains only 2 weeks old, you're going to get higher bounce rates and won't utilize the infrastructure as well as possible."

**Why this matters:**
- Forces clients to slow down (good for discovery)
- Technical necessity for deliverability
- Built into Month 1 timeline naturally

---

## Service Evolution: Why They Changed

### OLD MODEL (Doesn't Work):
**"Do it ourselves" - 10-20 BDRs sending for clients**

**Why it failed for horizontal software:**
- AEs own huge portions of market
- Lots of territory conflicts
- Stepping on feet constantly
- Doesn't scale for platforms anyone can use

### NEW MODEL (Current):
**"Set up infrastructure" - 3-month engagement to build systems**

**Why this works:**
- Client owns the system
- Teachable and sustainable
- No territory conflicts (they run it internally)
- Partners with HubSpot experts for CRM side
- Focuses on what compounds over time

## Actionable Takeaways for Drive ROI Offering

### 1. **Adopt 3-Month Minimum (Already doing this ✅)**
Your Phase 1 at $4K/mo for 3 months = $12K matches their timeline.

**Add explicit milestone structure:**
- Month 1: Discovery & Audit + Infrastructure reservation
- Month 2: Infrastructure build + Campaign launch
- Month 3: Iteration & Education + Handoff prep

### 2. **Add "30-Day Warmup" to Discovery Pitch**
**Current problem:** Clients want to "start sending immediately"

**New framing:** 
> "We reserve your email infrastructure on Day 1, but it requires a 30-day warmup period before sending. This isn't a delay - it's exactly the time we need for discovery, ICP definition, and campaign strategy. Companies that skip this end up taking LONGER to see results."

**Benefits:**
- Technical necessity becomes strategic advantage
- Forces proper discovery
- Sets expectations that nothing happens in Month 1 (good thing)

### 3. **Emphasize "Teaching" Over "Doing"**
**Stellar Growth insight:** "Who will own this after we leave?"

**Your "Build → Run → Prove → Handoff" model:** Already addresses this!

**Strengthen messaging:**
> "We don't just set up infrastructure and disappear. Over 3 months, we TEACH your team to operate these systems. By Month 3, you own everything - domains, prompts, workflows, documentation. No vendor lock-in."

### 4. **Add Attribution Tracking to Standard Deliverables**
**Their insight:** "Campaigns that failed by reply rate were driving website traffic"

**Add to your offering:**
- Website visitor identification (KnowFirst, Clearbit Reveal, etc.)
- Outbound sync to track cross-channel attribution
- Dashboard showing: Emails sent → Website visits → Other channel conversions

**Pitch:**
> "We track more than just reply rates. Most outbound campaigns get 2-5x more engagement than replies show. We'll prove outbound's impact even if someone doesn't reply."

### 5. **Create "Signal Setup" as Explicit Deliverable**
**Their list:**
- Website visitors
- ICP job changes & hires
- Outbound sync
- Niche vertical signals

**Your deliverable:**
> "Signal Monitoring Infrastructure"
> - Website visitor tracking
> - Job change alerts for your TAM
> - New hire monitoring (target roles)
> - Cross-channel attribution
> - Custom signals for your vertical
> **Value:** These compound over time. Month 6 signals feed Month 12 campaigns.

### 6. **80/20 TAM Mapping (Add to Positioning)**
**Their philosophy:** "People who aim for 100% TAM are wasting time."

**Your approach:**
> "We map 80% of your TAM in Phase 1 using best customer analysis and AI-driven look-alikes. The other 20%? We'll get there in Phase 2 when we have real data on what's working."

**Benefits:**
- Faster time to launch
- Focus on highest-value targets first
- Data-driven expansion (not guessing)

### 7. **"Say Hello" Campaign Framework**
**Their strategy:** 2-email sequence to entire TAM just to create awareness

**Your application:**
> "Phase 1 includes a broad 'Market Awareness' campaign - 2 emails to 80% of your TAM. Goal: Let the market know you exist. Secondary goal: Identify who's interested for targeted follow-up."

**Why this works:**
- Sets lower pressure expectations (not expecting meetings immediately)
- Builds list of engaged prospects for Phase 2
- Creates "private ads network" effect

### 8. **Backend Qualification (For Larger Clients)**
**Their recommendation:** "For larger SaaS, do most qualification on the backend"

**Your service tier:**
- **SMB/Mid-Market ($4K/mo):** You help with qualification
- **Enterprise ($7K+/mo):** You handle backend qualification fully
  - Positive reply comes in
  - You enrich, score, route to right rep
  - BDR gets Slack notification with full context

**Upsell opportunity:** "Qualification as a service"

## Risks & Considerations

### 1. **Complexity of 3-Month Engagements**
**Risk:** Scope creep, project management overhead, client handholding

**Mitigation:**
- Clear milestone structure (Discovery → Build → Educate)
- Weekly check-ins (not daily)
- Documentation at each phase
- Explicit "bottlenecks are usually client-side, not ours" framing

### 2. **"We Don't See Results in Month 1"**
**Risk:** Client cancels after Month 1 if no pipeline

**Mitigation:**
- Contract is 3-month minimum (already doing this)
- Set expectations in discovery: "Month 1 is discovery, Month 2 is launch"
- Show progress metrics: CRM enriched, signals set up, infrastructure live
- Share "9-month story" - best companies iterate to success

### 3. **Teaching vs. Doing (Client Dependency)**
**Risk:** Client wants you to "just do it" forever

**Mitigation:**
- "Build → Run → Prove → Handoff" model makes this explicit
- Phase 1 = Learn together, Phase 2 = We run it, Phase 3+ = You run it with our oversight
- Charge more for Phase 2+ if they want you to keep running it

### 4. **HubSpot Complexity**
**Risk:** You're not a HubSpot expert (their model: partner with HubSpot experts)

**Mitigation (Options):**
1. Partner with HubSpot consultant for complex implementations
2. Limit to "basic HubSpot enrichment" (as they mentioned)
3. Use other CRMs you know better (Attio, Clarify)
4. Position yourself as "CRM-agnostic" (work with their chosen platform)

   - Execution = Do it for them ongoing
   - Hybrid = Both tiers available

2. **How do we handle HubSpot complexity?**
   - Partner with expert?
   - Focus on other CRMs?
   - Basic HubSpot only?

3. **What's our attribution tech stack?**
   - Website visitor ID tool?
   - Outbound sync tool?
   - Dashboard tool?

4. **Do we want to follow their "Say Hello to TAM" approach?**
   - 2 emails to broad TAM
   - Low pressure, just awareness
   - vs. hyper-targeted from Day 1

5. **How do we differentiate from Stellar Growth?**
   - Premium positioning (Georgetown MBA, PE portfolio)
   - International expansion (Brenda's languages, US market entry)
   - Finance/analytics depth (board-ready reporting, RevOps + FP&A)
   - Vertical SaaS focus (CFO/HR/Construction tech)
   - PE portfolio companies (operating partner language)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Your positioning should emphasize:**

> "We build premium GTM infrastructure for companies that need more than templates.  
>  
> **Different from typical agencies:**  
> - We don't just set up Clay tables - we build systems your CFO will love (board-ready analytics)  
> - We don't just launch campaigns - we teach you to run them (Build → Run → Prove → Handoff)  
> - We don't work with everyone - we specialize in PE portfolio companies, international expansion to US, and vertical SaaS  
>  
> **What makes us different:**  
> - Georgetown MBA + PE portfolio experience (not just GTM operators)  
> - Brenda's 3 languages + international expansion expertise  
> - Finance/RevOps depth (we speak to CFOs and CROs equally)  
>  
> **Timeline:** 3 months to build, 3 months to prove, ongoing partnership if you want it."
