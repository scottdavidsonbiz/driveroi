## Pain Points

### 1. Zero Direct Customer Acquisition Motion
**Quote:** *"Typically what ends up happening in the space is everyone just leans on trying to go grab carrier Rep attention... we just kinda sit off to the back and wait for a lead to come over. But we need to get more."*

**Impact:**
- Completely dependent on carrier reps for leads (passive)
- Previous company did $50-60M/year with ZERO direct customer motion
- Carriers are now pressuring: *"don't just sit and I don't wanna pay you and pay my Rep for the same deal. Like what are you doing to drive opportunities in?"*

### 2. Unclear ICP / Too Broad
**Quote:** *"I don't know if you do like. Here's one customer profile. We're gonna drill and kill. Or if it's like, hey, here's a Customer profile that for like a 500 or 1000 person organization... versus if you go down into like kind of a mid market size company... So I don't know. That's a kind of the wheel the the the part of the business that I'm trying to speak to."*

**Challenge:** Target shifts between:
- CIOs (1000+ employee companies)
- IT directors / VPs (200-500 employees)
- SMB service businesses (plumbers, HVAC, electricians, construction)
- New business owners (transactional, high volume)

### 3. Can't Compete with Carrier Marketing Budgets
**Quote:** *"'Better Business Internet'... that's a super competitive online category. We don't have the budgets to go compete because in that sense we would be out there competing against those carriers."*

**Reality:** No paid ads, no formal online lead gen, starting from scratch

### 4. Minimal CRM Usage / No Tracking
**Quote:** *"HubSpot is what we have and I I use it haphazardly, but I use the free like 2 license thing they got."*

**Impact:** No pipeline visibility, no forecasting, no stage definitions

### 5. Too Many Competing Priorities
**Quote:** *"I literally like I can throw a net anywhere and sell something to somebody. It's it's annoying to me."*

**Challenge:** Spread thin, needs focus

## Buying Triggers

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Launching AT&T Partnership Monday (Jan 13, 2026)
**Quote:** *"We're officially launching this into AT&T on Monday... in the next call it 60 days like I expect to see a lot of volume. So if that's 10 orders a day. That would be, I think, realistic."*

**Timeline:**
- Goes live Monday
- Expecting 10 orders/day within 60 days
- AT&T senior leadership excited about their ordering portal

**Math:** 10 orders/day × $550 AOV = $5,500/day = $165K/month revenue at scale

### 2. Market Development Funds (MDF) Available NOW
**Quote:** *"Verizon allows for. It's like $50,000 in annual market development funds for like their top tier partners... if we could come up with like a this is an approach. This is what we expect. It's really calculated, measured. I could go in and ask for Market development funds to invest... it wouldn't even be money out of my pocket."*

**Opportunity:**
- $50K+ available from carriers/OEMs
- Needs: business case, approach, expected results
- Free money if he can show a plan

### 3. Channel Multiplier Effect
**Quote:** *"The more if you can bring them business, they're gonna give you it back 510 times over."*

**Logic:** Show carrier reps direct motion → Get 5-10x more inbound leads from them

### 4. "Good Sizzle Right Now"
**Quote:** *"We have some good sizzle right now for lack of a better term."*

Hot moment with carriers, momentum building, wants to capitalize

## Objections / Concerns

### 1. Don't Over-Invest Upfront
**Quote:** *"I don't know if you want to don't spend like a million years on it or anything like that. Just something something basic."*

**Approach:** Lightweight proof of concept, test & iterate

### 2. Cash Flow Constraint (Without MDF)
**Quote:** *"Otherwise you know, it'd probably just get into a situation where we're waiting on some of those sales to come through from the channel to produce the revenues to then do the campaign."*

**Solution:** Secure MDF first, then execute

### 3. Busy / Lots of Competing Priorities
**Quote:** *"I'm not in a super rush. I have a million things going on always."*

**Risk:** Could lose momentum if not kept engaged

## Opportunities

### Immediate Next Steps (What Bryan Explicitly Requested)

**1. Create MDF Business Case / Proposal**
**Quote:** *"What I would need is something to go back to the an OEM or an OEM to or with rather and say hey, I've been working on this... here's the plan."*

**Components:**
- Target ICP (recommended: SMB service businesses)
- Approach (LinkedIn + cold email outbound)
- Expected costs
- Expected results / ROI
- Metrics tracking plan

**Timeline:** Follow-up scheduled for Wednesday, Jan 15 at 1pm

### Strategic Opportunities

#### 1. Define Clear ICP Segmentation
**Recommended Focus:** SMB service-based businesses

**Quote:** *"SMB focused... blue collar type businesses, service based businesses... Plumbers HVAC's, electricians like construction... mobile workforce tablets in the field phones on... drivers, connected vehicles... franchises"*

**Why This ICP:**
- High connectivity needs (mobile workforce, field payments)
- Quick decision cycles (owner is economic buyer)
- Volume game (hundreds of thousands in TAM)
- Clear triggers (new business filings, 2nd location, hiring)

#### 2. Multi-Motion GTM Strategy

**Motion 1: Always-On SMB Outbound**
- Trigger: New business filings (LLC formation in state)
- Persona: Owner
- Volume: High (thousands)
- Channel: Cold email primary, LinkedIn secondary
- Message: "Better Business Internet" + field payment enablement

**Motion 2: Enterprise ABM (Secondary)**
- Target: 100 accounts (500-1000 employees)
- Persona: CIO, VP IT
- Channel: LinkedIn primary
- Buying committee mapping required

**Motion 3: Channel Partner Enablement (Existing, Keep Going)**
- Keep doing what's working
- Use direct motion metrics to get more carrier rep priority

#### 3. Positioning Differentiation
**Quote:** *"We have Better Business networking equipment... You're not gonna use the consumer grade devices that they give you. You're gonna get business grade or enterprise grade equipment."*

**Value Props:**
- Business-grade equipment (vs consumer-grade carrier devices)
- Better antennas, throughput, signal
- Out-of-box provisioning
- National installation partners
- Carrier-agnostic (AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, etc.)

**Use Case Example:**
*"Machine shop in backyard, metal building blocks signal. Drill through wall, run external antenna, go from 1 MB → 200 MB download. Simple solution carrier reps can't provide = churn prevention."*

#### 4. Economics That Work

**Order Economics:**
- AOV: $550
- Gross margin: $200 (30-35%)
- Target volume: 10 orders/day at scale
- Monthly revenue potential: $165K
- Monthly margin: $60K

**CAC:**
- Cold outbound = low CAC
- SMB = fast sales cycle
- Transactional motion

**Customer Acquisition Strategy:**
- Test segments (HVAC vs plumbing vs construction vs franchises)
- Measure CAC by segment
- Double down on winners

#### 5. Rev Ops Foundation Needed

**Current State:** HubSpot free tier, used haphazardly

**Opportunity:**
- Implement proper CRM tracking
- Define deal stages
- Lead & account scoring
- Pipeline reporting
- Forecasting (especially with 60-day SMB cycles)
- Board reporting for investors/OEMs

**Quote from Scott:** *"We do some Rev op stuff too on the back end like CRM, HubSpot, we do like board reporting and also just go to market reporting... health of pipeline staging."*

## Content / Messaging Ideas

### Headline: "Better Business Internet"
- Strong, clear positioning
- But: super competitive online (can't compete with carrier budgets)
- Solution: Niche down to specific verticals

### Alternative Angles:

**1. Field Payment Enablement**
*"Start collecting payments on-site. We provide the connectivity + tablets that let your HVAC techs close deals in the driveway, not wait for invoices."*

**2. Mobile Workforce Connectivity**
*"Your plumbers are on job sites all day. Give them the connectivity they need to update jobs, order parts, and check schedules in real-time."*

**3. Churn Prevention for Carrier Reps**
*"We solve the connectivity problems that make your customers leave. Metal buildings, weak signal areas, high-bandwidth needs—we have the equipment carriers don't."*

## Positioning Implications for Scott + Brenda

### What This Opportunity Highlights:

1. **MDF Funding Angle:** Companies can get free money from vendors/carriers if they have a solid GTM plan. This is a great unlock for clients who say "we don't have budget" — we can help them GET budget.

2. **Channel + Direct Hybrid Model:** Bryan's case shows that channel-only works (his previous company did $50-60M) but carriers want proof of direct motion too. We can help channel partners add the direct layer.

3. **Volume Plays Are Our Wheelhouse:** SMB transactional motion with $200 margins and fast sales cycles = perfect for data-driven, high-volume outbound

4. **Rev Ops Value Add:** Even if they come for "lead gen," the real value is the full stack: ICP → outbound → CRM setup → pipeline reporting → board metrics

5. **Test & Iterate Positioning:** Bryan's "don't spend a million years on it" = he wants lean, scrappy POC first, then scale winners. This aligns with our approach.
