# Meeting Insights: Clay Project Scoping - Scott Davidson & Ben Krevalin

## Executive Summary
Ben Krevalin (PatientFi) and Scott Davidson discussed a low-budget Clay automation project for the dental DSO vertical. Ben needs help enriching 4,000 CRM records, implementing lead scoring, and managing email outreach campaigns. The conversation revealed Ben's "spray and pray" approach due to limited resources and his need to prove ROI before getting company buy-in for sophisticated GTM tools.

## Key Insights
- **PatientFi Business**: Buy-now-pay-later for healthcare (fertility, cosmetic surgery, dental); focus on DSOs with 10+ locations.
- **Current State**: Messy CRM (Sugar), manual prospecting using free Hunter tool and LinkedIn, archaic process that Ben acknowledges is inefficient.
- **Budget Constraints**: Ben offering $500 for initial scope, acknowledging it's below market but trying to prove ROI with limited personal/company resources.
- **Lead Scoring Challenge**: Limited publicly available signals; DSO size and service offerings (implants vs. general dentistry) are key but hard to quantify from websites alone.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Data Quality**: 4,230 accounts in CRM with incorrect/incomplete data (e.g., 100+ location DSO showing "1 location").
- **Manual Research**: Opening LinkedIn, guessing emails, using free tools - extremely time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Lack of Intent Signals**: Hard to identify which DSOs are high-value targets without understanding their revenue mix (implants vs. general dentistry).
- **Commoditized Market**: Many competitors in patient financing space; need unique messaging and targeting.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Scott**: Put together proposal outlining Phase 1 scope (data enrichment, lead scoring, CRM export) and ongoing outreach management pricing.
- [ ] **Scott**: Include breakdown of tooling costs (Clay, instantly, domains, email inboxes).
- [ ] **Scott**: Define success metrics and timeline clearly to avoid scope misalignment.
- [ ] **Ben**: Share 4,000-record CSV export from Sugar CRM.
- [ ] **Ben**: Provide list of competitors and ideal customer examples.
- [ ] **Ben**: Review proposal and get back to Scott early next week.

## Context & Details
- **Participants**: Scott Davidson (GTM Consultant), Ben Krevalin (PatientFi Enterprise Sales).
- **Companies**:
    - **PatientFi**: Healthcare financing platform, focus on DSOs, competitive market.
    - **Scott**: New consulting business, seeking early clients and testimonials.
- **Tools Discussed**: Clay, instantly, Sugar CRM, Disco (account finding tool), email verification tools.
- **Deal Cycles**: 2-6 weeks for 10-location DSOs; 6-12 months for 100+ location DSOs.
