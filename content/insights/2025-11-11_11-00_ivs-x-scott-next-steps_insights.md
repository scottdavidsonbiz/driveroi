# Meeting Insights: IVS Final Decision Meeting

## Executive Summary
Miguel Morales provided an update on two separate projects: (1) clinical dashboards where Michelle/Mike need more time to decide (answer by Tuesday), and (2) a new sales planning need for territory mapping and capacity planning for 2026. Miguel's team lacks bandwidth to connect the dots between their market data and sales territories, creating an opportunity for Scott to help with account prioritization and rep assignment.

## Key Insights
- **Dashboard Project Status**: Michelle hesitant due to lack of industry knowledge concerns; worried about time investment to explain requirements.
- **New Sales Opportunity**: IVS needs help with 2026 business planning - mapping opportunity accounts to 11 sales regions across 4 counties (Orlando/Brevard).
- **Current Target**: 189 admissions/day → goal of 250/day; need territory structure and account targeting to achieve growth.
- **Data Access**: IVS pays for Trella Health data showing Medicare business by geography, but no one has bandwidth to synthesize it into actionable territories.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Michelle's Concern**: Wants someone with industry knowledge who won't require extensive hand-holding; fears time drain.
- **Territory Mapping**: Have opportunity data and regions in "two separate places" - need pairing of accounts to territories with backward math for rep capacity.
- **Sales Team Growth**: Need to determine how many reps required, where to deploy them, and whether current reps are focused on right accounts.
- **Missed Calls**: Using Lucy AI but unsure if it's solving the problem of missed customer calls.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Miguel**: Get final answer from Michelle/Mike on dashboards by Tuesday (next week).
- [ ] **Miguel**: Show Scott Trella Health CRM and data in screen share on Tuesday, November 18 at 3pm ET.
- [ ] **Scott**: Prepare for deep dive on sales territory mapping, account prioritization, and capacity planning discussion.
- [ ] **Miguel**: Consider this as separate workstream from clinical dashboards if Michelle/Mike decline that project.

## Context & Details
- **Participants**: Scott Davidson (Consultant), Miguel Morales (IVS Business Development).
- **Companies**:
    - **IVS**: Home health services, serving 4 counties in Florida, targeting physicians, hospitals, nursing homes.
    - **Tools**: Trella Health (industry-specific CRM with Medicare data).
- **Referral Sources**: Physicians, hospitals, nursing homes.
- **Target Clients**: Organizations with high Medicare patient populations; currently 100-180 admissions, targeting 250.
