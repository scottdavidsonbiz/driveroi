# Scott-Brenda Partnership Negotiation: Working Through the Structure

**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Context:** Private discussion AFTER the Marcos/Treasury Hub call
**Participants:** Scott, Brenda
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

## Executive Summary

This conversation shows Scott and Brenda **actively negotiating** the partnership structure. Unlike the earlier discussion where Brenda said she wanted to focus on "demand gen only," this conversation reveals a **potential division of labor** that could work:

- **Scott:** Technical systems (Clay implementation, workflow design)
- **Brenda:** GTM strategy (ICP definition, sales playbooks, packaging, client prep)
- **Both:** Selling together, client engagement

**Key outcome:** They're moving toward alignment on:
1. Target market (PE/VC/Family Offices + companies entering US)
2. Service tiers (DIY, Done-with-you, Done-for-you)
3. Division of responsibilities (systems vs. strategy)

**Remaining uncertainty:** Still testing hypotheses, "we don't know what we don't know"

---

## Part 1: The Core Issue - 1+1=2 vs. 1+1=3

### Scott's Concern (Direct Quote)

> "Both of us setting up DemandGen with this stack... I don't think the execution of it requires multiple people. Because... the benefit of both of us working together is like we would just **double our capacity for the same... it'd be like 1 + 1 equals 2.**
>
> Whereas, you know, **if you handle sales and I handle ops and whatever, whatever it looks like, I see it as more like multiplicative, like, you know, 1 + 1 equals 3.**"

**Translation:**
- If both doing Clay execution → just capacity doubling (not partnership value)
- If complementary roles → multiplicative value creation (real partnership)

This is the clearest articulation of Scott's partnership concern.

### Scott's Direct Question

> "What I'm trying to determine is like: **Is this more of a referral relationship** where like you get a CRM job and they need DemandGen and then I just do that and you do the CRM and vice versa...
>
> **Or is it more like it's actually like a true partnership**, and we can define the partnership today as this scope, but for the overall value of the organization... having more revenue streams is better than fewer."

**Scott is asking:** Are we building one company together, or are we just cross-referring?

---

## Part 2: Brenda's Proposed Division of Labor

### What Brenda Heard

> "If you're telling me **on the technical side, I got us covered. You need to sell.** So that's what I'm reading between lines, right?"

**Scott's response:** "I hear you." (Not disagreeing)

### Brenda's Offer

> "Then I kind of start structuring everything, doing like actually doing what they do, which is like **the go to market, the strategy**... Like you take the ICP, like doing all of that for us and then for our clients.
>
> If we were having discovering calls with Marcus, **I will have used a different type of methodology** on like what type of questions we need to be asking, what type of bare minimums we need... I will develop that playbook... these are the things that we need to ask and then put that like in a systematic way."

**Translation:** Brenda would focus on:
- ICP definition and research
- Discovery call methodology and questionnaires
- Client prep and proposal development
- GTM strategy and positioning
- Packaging and productization

### On Learning Clay

> "I need to understand, like really well what's feasible. And then with that I can just go with it. And, and, **but that is not on you**, you know, like I can do it **on my own time**... you can share with me some materials or some examples or things like that."

**Important:** She's willing to learn Clay on her own time, not expecting Scott to teach her.

---

## Part 3: What Each Person Adds (Their Own Assessment)

### What Brenda Thinks Scott Adds

> "You have a lot of the input in your Clay universe, right? And then you see a lot like how people are solving problems for businesses. But then at the same time, **you're senior enough to cut through the noise** and saying like, oh this is just like being busy for being busy and this is like actually a good business case.
>
> Also **you connect that to finance. Which is like the most powerful thing**... nothing on building go to market systems... is not valuable if you actually if you don't book business. So I think that **you're tied up with forecasting and with the numbers is the value** there."

**Brenda sees Scott's value as:**
1. Clay ecosystem knowledge (technical)
2. Seniority to cut through noise (judgment)
3. Connection to finance/numbers (FP&A background)
4. Focus on business outcomes, not just activity

### How Brenda Sees Her Role

> "If we were engaged since the beginning and we say like this is a customer we want to win, probably what I could have done differently it's like **prep for the different calls** and then I have a questionnaire like these are the different types of questions that we need and then all that playbook on **requesting data, preparing better, having a nice proposal. Focusing on closing the customer, knowing him**...
>
> You designed the system and I'm comfortable with designing the system as well, but if we want to divide things like will you design the system but then **I package all of that into: This is a product.**"

**Brenda sees her role as:**
1. Sales methodology and client prep
2. Proposal development and packaging
3. Productization (turning system into sellable offering)
4. GTM strategy for the partnership AND for clients

### The Strength They Agree On

> **Brenda:** "I think that that's the strength that we have. Because **we can see strategy, but also we can implement systems**."
>
> **Scott:** "Yes" (agrees)

Both acknowledge: Strategy + Implementation is their combined differentiator.

---

## Part 4: Target Market Alignment

### Brenda's Strong Preference: PE/VC/Family Offices

> "If we want to target somebody, I would like to target **Family offices, PE officers, and VCs** and then we do the demand generation or go to marketing engineer or whatever for them... because at the end, **they already have like a pipeline of people and it's better to be plugged into that universe** and have a pipeline of people."

**Reasoning:**
- Network effect of being in that ecosystem
- They have portfolio companies (built-in pipeline)
- High-value, repeatable clients

**Scott's response:** "Yeah, I think there's a strong... built in network effect... I definitely think we should test that."

### Scott's Addition: Companies Entering US Market

> **Scott:** "I'm thinking like about the finance office of the finance software as like a potential differentiation point just because I can [speak to CFOs]."
>
> **Brenda:** "I have seen also a lot happening right now... **European company that is entering the US market**... based in London and Switzerland, now they're entering the US market and they want to expand here and also they want to expand in Latin America...
>
> Also... **a company that was based in Germany**... a company in the US purchased it and now they're looking for the first RevOps hire... **other companies are being consolidated and they want to enter the US market** like in different ways."

**Emerging pattern:** European/LatAm companies entering US market is a real, validated segment.

### Geographic Focus

> **Brenda:** "Mostly in the US if we want to be like hyper targeted in the US, **New York, and DC base**. So in the case that they want to meet us for some reason, it's just easier."

**Scott:** "OK. That works."

### Investment Criteria

- B2B SaaS or professional services
- Not home services or B2C
- PE/VC portfolio companies in tech/software

---

## Part 5: Service Offering Structure

### Tiered Packaging: DIY, Done-With-You, Done-For-You

**Scott:** "The way I've seen some packaging happen is it's you know, **DIY, Done with you, and done for you**. And then it's based, you know, the pricing is reflective of that."

### Brenda's Segmentation by Client Type

**Solopreneurs (like Marcos):**
> "We build a system, the demand generation engine for you. And then we teach you how to do it."

**Small businesses / Scale-ups:**
> Different level of hand-holding and strategy support

### Key Question: Do They Want Clients Without ICP?

> **Brenda:** "We can have like a questionnaire of **do you have an ICP defined**? Like **how many customers have you had**?"
>
> **Scott:** "And then we ask the question, **do we even want to serve that market that doesn't have an ICP**? Yes or no, maybe we do."

**Implication:** Need to define minimum client requirements (ICP definition, customer traction, etc.)

### Fixed Scope vs. Recurring

**Scott:** "Then we need to ask ourselves, do we want that to be **fixed scope with a fixed timeline or ongoing recurring**."

This is still TBD.

## Part 6: Additional Service Components

### LinkedIn Ads

**Brenda:** "I have experienced **running and analyzing LinkedIn ads**... I haven't done it for Facebook and Google... I did it before ChatGPT was this strong... I just need to get updated on that."

**Scott:** LinkedIn ads using founder content (boosted posts) - high ROI

**Agreement:** Start with LinkedIn ads, skip Meta/Google for now

### Content Creation

**Brenda:** "I am fairly good at making content, or I was when I was creating content, like 5 years ago... I got paid, which is like for me it was crazy because I was riding a blog. And I make probably in total like **$5K**, which is not a lot, but it was a lot from a blog."

**Agreement:** Content is important BUT needs ICP defined first.

> **Brenda:** "I have been hesitant right now in pulling the trigger just because **I don't have an ICP**... we need to define the offering and then after that, I don't want to be creating content for the fact of creating content."

**Scott agrees:** Offering, pricing, packaging must come first.

---

## Part 7: Go-To-Market Strategy for Partnership

### First 10 Clients: Referrals

**Brenda's prediction:**
> "I feel heavily that **our the first jobs that we will have, like probably the 1st 10, will be referrals.** And what we need to do is **define the offering and basically the pricing and packaging for it** and start hitting our networks."

**Scott agrees.**

### Outbound for Partnership

**Brenda:** "I wouldn't expect [our own outbound] to have a lot of results. But then at the same time, I wonder like **if I don't expect to have a lot of results on us, like how can we bring results on our clients**. So it's like, I don't know, we can try."

**Scott's response:** If they get hyperspecific AND have proof point (e.g., Marcos success), outbound could work.

### Content as Long-Term Play

**Scott:** "Content is a longer term game, but I think that getting inbound content is very [valuable]."

References:
- Understory Alex: multimillion dollar business, LinkedIn content was key
- Another GTM person: 70% of business comes from people who've seen her content

**Agreement:** Content is valuable but secondary to defining offering first.

---

## Part 8: The Honest Uncertainties

### "We Don't Know What We Don't Know"

**Brenda (multiple times):**
> "I think that we don't know what we don't know... **if it is really easy for us, it's really easy for anyone.** But then I don't know exactly how... we'll need to discover together... **how do we get from, I'm just sending a bunch of emails to actually we're having a minimal meaningful conversation and then that turns into a customer**. And I think that needs way more iteration..."

**Scott agrees:** "That's true... we haven't done it."

### Testing Hypotheses

**Brenda:** "Yeah, I think that right now it's like **a lot of hypothesis on how we're going to work together** and probably everything will get messy at some point."

**Scott:** "I think we're at the point where we test."

---

## Part 9: Is This a Referral Relationship or Partnership?

### Brenda's Answer (When Asked Directly)

> **Brenda:** "The straight answer is **I don't know** because right now we don't have any actual demand ourselves. So I don't know exactly like how that will look like.
>
> **I don't think that I can do things myself without working with you**... I think that the strength is in working together. So **I don't see it as a referral... I see it like we get involved together.**"

**Translation:**
- She doesn't want it to be just referrals
- She thinks they need each other
- But uncertainty because no clients yet

## Key Insights

### 1. A Division of Labor IS Emerging

**Different from earlier concerns:**
- Scott handles: Technical/systems (Clay, workflows, implementation)
- Brenda handles: Strategy/GTM (ICP, sales methodology, packaging, productization)
- Both: Selling together to clients

**This could be 1+1=3** if executed properly.

### 2. Target Market Alignment is Strong

Both agree on:
- **Primary:** PE/VC/Family Offices (Brenda's preference)
- **Secondary:** Companies entering US market (Scott + Brenda both see demand)
- **Tertiary:** Finance software/Office of CFO (Scott's differentiation)

Geographic: NY, DC, US-focused

### 3. Brenda Acknowledges Clay Knowledge Gap But Will Learn

> "I need to understand what's feasible... I can do it on my own time."

She's not expecting Scott to teach her, which is positive. She'll learn to inform her strategy work.

### 4. Service Structure Taking Shape

- **DIY/Done-With-You/Done-For-You** tiers
- **Solopreneurs** vs. **Scale-ups** segmentation
- Question: Minimum client requirements (must have ICP defined? customer traction?)
- Fixed scope vs. recurring (TBD)

### 5. First 10 Clients = Referrals

Both agree:
- Define offering/pricing/packaging FIRST
- Hit their networks
- Get proof points before scaling outbound

### 6. Honest About Uncertainty

Both acknowledge:
- "We don't know what we don't know"
- Need to test hypotheses
- Will iterate and learn

**This is healthy** - not over-promising or assuming.

### 7. Not a Referral Relationship (Per Brenda)

When asked directly, Brenda said:
- "I don't see it as a referral"
- "I see it like we get involved together"
- She thinks the strength is in working together

But also: "I don't know" because no clients yet.

## What Changed from Earlier Conversations

### Before This Call

- Brenda: "I only want to focus on demand gen"
- Scott: "That doesn't make sense, I'm building that myself"
- Unclear division of labor

### After This Call

- Brenda: "You handle technical, I'll handle GTM strategy"
- Scott: "That could work if it's 1+1=3"
- Clear(er) division of labor emerging

### Key Shift

**Brenda moved from:**
- "I want to learn Clay and do demand gen execution"

**To:**
- "You do the systems, I'll do the GTM strategy, ICP, sales methodology, packaging"

**This is a much better fit for:**
- Scott's strengths (technical, Clay, systems)
- Brenda's strengths (GTM strategy, ICP, sales, packaging)

## Remaining Questions for Friday

Despite progress, still need clarity on:

1. **Revenue split:** How do they split income?
2. **Decision-making:** Who decides what?
3. **Time commitment:** Hours/week each person commits?
4. **Equity vs. profit-sharing:** Building one company or partnership LLC?
5. **Exit scenarios:** What if one person wants out?

---

## Bottom Line Assessment

**This conversation is MUCH more productive than the earlier ones.**

**Progress made:**
- ✅ Division of labor emerging (systems vs. strategy)
- ✅ Target market aligned (PE/VC/FO + companies entering US)
- ✅ Service structure taking shape (DIY/DWY/DFY tiers)
- ✅ Both acknowledge uncertainty and need to test
- ✅ Brenda willing to learn Clay on her own time
- ✅ Agreement on first 10 clients from referrals

**Still uncertain:**
- ❓ Revenue split and legal structure
- ❓ Time commitments
- ❓ Is this truly 1+1=3 or still risky?

**For Friday's meeting:**
- Use this conversation as evidence of progress
- Clarify the remaining structural questions
- Decide: Move forward with this division of labor, or not?

**My assessment:** This is actually workable IF:
1. Brenda truly commits to GTM strategy role (not execution)
2. Scott is comfortable being the "systems person"
3. They can agree on revenue split and structure

**The division of labor Scott wanted IS emerging here.**
