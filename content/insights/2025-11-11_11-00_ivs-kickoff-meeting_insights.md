# Meeting Insights: IVS Kickoff - Scott, Jeffrey, & Jennifer

## Executive Summary
Final kickoff meeting with both IVS partners (Jeffrey and Jennifer Cohen) to align on strategic foundation, implementation approach, and campaign setup. Deep dive into ZoomInfo intent data capabilities/limitations, LinkedIn automation strategy, email quality standards, and case study publication approach. Confirmed infrastructure ownership model and timeline for Thanksgiving setup → December launch.

## Key Insights

### ZoomInfo Intent Data: Deep Dive & Limitations Confirmed

**What IVS Currently Has:**
- Weekly intent reports every Tuesday morning
- 4-5 intent pulls configured:
  - Manufacturing companies (US) searching "property tax," "business personal property tax," "compliance"
  - Larger companies searching same terms
  - Industrial companies searching "property tax services"
  - Fortune 500 companies searching "property tax services"
- Scoring based on company type + search terms
- Website visitor tracking (installed but never reviewed)

**The Core Limitation (Validated):**
> "The problem that our current marketer has had with this... it could be anyone in that IP range that's kind of looking for that. So it might not necessarily be the people that we were looking for."

**Translation:** IP-level intent data can't distinguish WHO in the company searched - could be intern, could be CFO, unknown.

**IVS's Current Workaround:**
- Filter by persona after pulling intent (C-suite, accounting department)
- Manually review before outreach
- Still getting false positives

**Scott's Alternative Approach:**
- Use job change intent (new CFO/tax manager = real signal, not IP-based)
- 10K filings (first-party, company-specific data)
- Website visitors (if properly implemented)
- ZoomInfo as ONE source, not the only source

**CSV Export Capability:**
- IVS has 5,000 export credits
- Can dump contact information for searches
- Worst case: CSV export → Clay import → enrichment

**API Access:**
- Unknown if current tier includes API
- Likely don't have it anymore (downgraded plan)
- May need to rely on CSV exports + manual import

### Email Quality Control: Current Marketer Problems Exposed

**The Bad Example (Shown During Call):**
Jeffrey shared example email from current marketer:
- **Problem:** 4x too long for effective outbound
- **Problem:** AI-written, generic, no personalization
- **Problem:** "No one's gonna take that long to read"

**IVS Review/Approval Process:**
> "We feel like we have to review everything that gets sent out before it gets sent out so that we can make sure there are mistakes in it or... make sure that there's nothing that we can't do either ethically or professionally... guaranteeing results or... using wording that we won't necessarily agree with because it would potentially be misleading."

**Translation:**
- Current marketer can't be trusted to write compliant copy
- IVS has professional/ethical standards (tax consulting = regulated)
- Can't guarantee results or mislead prospects
- Must manually review every email = bottleneck

**Scott's Proposed Solution:**
- **Short and sweet:** 3 blocks max (personalization, case study, CTA)
- **Template-based:** Pre-approved messaging frameworks, variables for personalization
- **Intent-driven:** "Hey, noticed you just started as CFO at [Company]..." (relevant, not generic)
- **Review process:** Messaging frameworks approved upfront, automation fills in variables

**Example Scott Provided:**
```
First line: Hyper-relevant personalization (noticed intent signal)
Second: Case study blurb (we've helped XYZ type save $X on tax)
Third: CTA (would it be helpful to have a conversation? / here's a framework)
```

**Why This Works for IVS:**
- Professional, not spammy
- Compliant with ethical standards
- Short enough people will read
- Personalized enough not to look automated

### LinkedIn Automation Strategy: Multithreading & Engagement Tactics

**Accounts to Use:**
- Jeffrey (partner, primary contact)
- Jennifer (partner, shown during call)
- James (partner, mentioned, hesitant about spam)
- Potentially current marketer (4th account)

**Volume Constraints:**
- 25 connections/day per person (LinkedIn safe limit)
- 3 accounts × 25/day = 75 connections/day
- 4 accounts × 25/day = 100 connections/day (if include marketer)

**Multithreading Approach:**
> "I guess my question regarding that would be like, so how often or how many people within like one company would we necessarily be contacting at the same time?"

**Scott's Answer:**
- **Enterprise accounts:** Multiple decision-makers (CFO, tax director, controller)
- **Small companies:** May only be one decision-maker
- **Strategy:** Identify buying committee, wedge in, expand

**Engagement Tactics Beyond Direct Outreach:**
1. **Profile views:** Automation views prospect profiles → they see IVS viewed them → may check out IVS profile
2. **Connection requests:** Personalized message with intent signal
3. **Direct messages:** Follow-up sequences if they accept
4. **Content engagement:** Automated comments/likes on prospect posts or posts they engage with frequently
   - Shows IVS is "active" in their feed
   - Increases visibility before direct outreach
   - Builds familiarity

**Content Strategy (For Prospect Engagement):**
- When prospects view IVS LinkedIn profiles, what do they see?
- **Options:**
  - Nothing → missed opportunity
  - Case studies (pinned posts) → engagement, social proof
  - Active engagement → credibility, expertise

**Scott's Recommendation:**
- Minimum: Pin case studies to profiles
- Ideal: Occasional posts (case studies, insights, industry news)
- Not required for Phase 1 but adds leverage

---

### Case Study Strategy: Publication & Usage

**What IVS Needs to Provide:**
- 1 case study per industry (spread across segments)
- Industries: Refining, pulp & paper, oil & gas, food & beverage, chemical

**Jeffrey's Confidence:**
> "I think we could definitely put together two or three of those... looking at the industry and the results that we had we can do a couple per or one or two per... two or three industries to start."

**Scott's Flexibility:**
- Start with 2-3 industries
- Test which resonates
- May not be case study that drives results (test to find out)

**Publication Plan:**
1. **Immediate use:** Email/LinkedIn outreach personalization
   - "We helped [similar company in your industry] save $X on property tax"
2. **Website:** Publish case studies (SEO, credibility)
3. **LinkedIn:** Publish and pin to partner profiles
4. **Referencing:** "We've achieved similar results for dozens of companies" (even if using one case study repeatedly)

**Why This Works:**
- Industry-specific social proof
- Credibility for prospects checking IVS online
- Personalization for outbound (relevant case study per industry)

---

### Infrastructure Ownership Model: No Vendor Lock-In

**Confirmed Approach:**
- **IVS owns all tools/accounts** (Clay, Hey Reach, instantly.ai, Make.com, domains, inboxes)
- **Scott manages setup/execution** (accesses IVS-owned accounts)
- **IVS retains ownership** if they part ways with Scott

**Why This Matters:**
- No vendor lock-in
- IVS can transition to in-house or different vendor easily
- Transparent cost structure (they see tool costs directly)
- Builds IVS capability (not dependent on Scott forever)

**Credentials Management:**
- Use 1Password (or similar) for secure credential sharing
- Joint account setup call to configure tools
- Scott gets access, IVS retains ownership

---

### Implementation Timeline & Deliverables Finalized

**Decision Timeline:**
- Meeting in Fort Worth (Jeffrey, Jennifer, James) Sunday-Monday-Tuesday
- Decision by end of week (Friday latest)

**Setup Timeline (If Approved):**
- **Before Thanksgiving:** Infrastructure setup
  - Domain purchasing
  - Email inbox creation
  - Email warmup (sending fake emails to each other to establish deliverability)
  - Clay setup and account list creation
  - LinkedIn automation tool setup
  - Messaging framework development
- **Thanksgiving Week:** Perfect for setup (low response rates anyway)
- **December:** Campaign launches
- **Goal:** Show momentum before year-end (critical for 2026 tax season)

**Deliverables (Confirmed):**
1. **ICP Document:** Industries, company types, personas, geography
2. **Account Lists:** Scored, prioritized, refined
3. **Messaging Frameworks:** Templates with personalization variables
4. **Intent Signal Monitoring:** Job changes, 10K filings, ZoomInfo intent, website visitors
5. **Campaign Launches:** LinkedIn sequences + email sequences
6. **Bi-weekly Strategy Calls:** Review, iterate, optimize
7. **Weekly Async Reports:** Reply rates, meeting rates, hypotheses, next steps

### Stakeholder Dynamics: Three-Partner Decision

**Who's Who:**
- **Jeffrey Cohen:** Primary contact, champion, most engaged
- **Jennifer Cohen:** Partner, present on this call, reviewing contract
- **James:** Partner (not present), needs buy-in, hesitant about LinkedIn spam

**Decision Process:**
- All three partners must align
- Fort Worth trip = in-person discussion opportunity
- "Hoping... the three of us can actually sit down and talk about this... make a decision... by the end of the week"

**Timeline Pressure:**
> "I'd like [to get going] as soon as possible so that we could get information... time frame is kind of coming up fast and we've already got the holidays that we need to work around."

**Primary Blocker:**
- Not budget (already discussed)
- Not scope (aligned on approach)
- **Partner alignment:** Need unanimous agreement
