# Meeting Insights: Proposal Review - Scott Davidson & Jeffrey Cohen

## Executive Summary
Scott presented a detailed proposal to Jeffrey outlining Phase 1 (3-month engagement at $4K/month) and Phase 2 (ongoing automation at $5.5K/month). The proposal covers ICP definition, territory carving, LinkedIn/email automation, and bi-weekly strategy reviews. Jeffrey needs to review with partners Jen and James before deciding, with decision expected by end of week.

## Key Insights
- **Pricing Structure**: Phase 1 = $4K/month + ~$500/month infrastructure; Phase 2 = $5.5K/month (includes CRM implementation and advanced workflows).
- **Quick Sprint Approach**: 2-week sprint to define ICP, messaging, and scoring; then launch campaigns with bi-weekly reviews and iteration.
- **Benchmark Expectations**: LinkedIn 20-30% reply rates (vs. 5-10% email); target 1 meeting per 500 contacts initially, aiming to improve.
- **Infrastructure Ownership**: IVS owns all tools/accounts to avoid vendor lock-in and enable easy transition if needed.

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Timeline Pressure**: Tax season bidding window closing soon; need to show momentum before year-end.
- **Partner Buy-In**: Jeffrey needs Jen and James approval; they're traveling to Massachusetts and won't decide until Friday.
- **LinkedIn Volume Constraints**: 25 connections/day per person; will use 3-4 LinkedIn accounts (partners + potentially marketer).
- **Hesitation on Spam Concerns**: James worried about being too aggressive on LinkedIn; Scott assured personalization prevents spam perception.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Jeffrey**: Review proposal with Jen and James while in Massachusetts; provide decision by Friday.
- [ ] **Jeffrey**: Potential group call next week with all three partners if interested in moving forward.
- [ ] **Scott**: Send proposal and presentation materials to Jeffrey.
- [ ] **Scott**: Be ready to start quickly if approved (potentially during Thanksgiving week for setup, launch in December).

## Context & Details
- **Participants**: Scott Davidson (GTM Consultant), Jeffrey Cohen (IVS).
- **Meeting Date**: November 3, 2025 (follow-up from October 29 discovery call).
- **Tools Proposed**: Clay ($350/month), LinkedIn automation ($79/person), instantly.ai ($97/month), Make.com ($11/month), email domains/inboxes (~$100/month).
- **Phase 1 Deliverables**: ICP doc, account lists, messaging frameworks, intent signal monitoring, campaign launches.
