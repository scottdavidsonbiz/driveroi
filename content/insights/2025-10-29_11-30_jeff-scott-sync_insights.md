# Meeting Insights: Discovery Call - Scott Davidson & Jeffrey Cohen

## Executive Summary
Scott Davidson and Jeffrey Cohen (property tax consultant) discussed IVS's stagnant sales growth despite having 26 years in business. Jeffrey outlined their challenges with current marketing approaches and showed interest in Scott's data-driven GTM strategy. The conversation covered their target market (industrial properties), competitive landscape, and Scott's modern approach using LinkedIn automation, intent data, and AI-driven workflows.

## Key Insights
- **IVS Background**: 26-year property tax consulting firm specializing in industrial properties (refineries, oil & gas, pulp & paper, chemical, food & beverage).
- **Current Challenge**: Post-COVID stagnation; current marketer making excuses rather than delivering results; competitors are growing while IVS plateaus.
- **Scott's Approach**: Modern intent-based marketing vs. spray-and-pray; use LinkedIn automation, Clay enrichment, 10K research, and targeted messaging.
- **Key Differentiator**: IVS does on-site visits and corporate-style service (always 2 people familiar with accounts, no surprises).

## Pain Points & Challenges
- **Marketing Ineffectiveness**: Current marketer blames market changes but provides no constructive solutions; relying on cold calls/email blasts without results.
- **Zoom Info Limitations**: Using Zoom Info for intent but getting false positives (IP-level data can't distinguish actual decision-makers).
- **Lack of Modern GTM**: No systematic approach to ICP definition, segmentation, or data-driven outreach.
- **Seasonal Pressure**: Tax season bidding window (need clients signed by January for 2026 tax year); short window to show results.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Jeffrey**: Complete homework exercise (ICP definition, value propositions, closed won/lost analysis).
- [ ] **Jeffrey**: Provide case studies across different industries (refining, pulp & paper, oil & gas).
- [ ] **Jeffrey**: Review proposal with partners Jen and James; decision by Friday after their Massachusetts trip.
- [ ] **Scott**: Send proposal and presentation materials.
- [ ] **Scott**: Schedule follow-up meeting week of November 10th to move forward.
