# LinkedIn Content Drafts - Scott Davidson

**Target Audience:** Series A/B B2B SaaS founders and GTM leaders (raised in last 6 months, no RevOps hire yet)
**Goal:** Thought leadership positioning DriveROI as the GTM infrastructure layer
**Positioning:** We build the infrastructure your GTM runs on. Not outbound execution. Not copywriting. Scoring, enrichment, CRM, reporting.
**Voice:** Operator, not consultant. Direct, no jargon. No em dashes.

## Post 1: Volume vs. Targeting

```
I used to believe hyper-targeting was everything.

Build a perfect list of 400 accounts. Nail the messaging. Quality over quantity.

Then I ran a test.

List A: 400 accounts, hand-picked. Response rate: 2.7%
List B: 4,000 accounts, broader filters. Response rate: 4%

List B won on both percentage AND total responses.

With 400 accounts, I didn't have enough data to learn anything. Every email felt precious. I was optimizing in the dark.

With 4,000 accounts, patterns emerged. Which subject lines worked. Which industries responded. Which titles ignored me.

Volume gave me the data to get better at targeting.

Don't over-engineer your first list. Get it out there. See what the market tells you. Then narrow down based on what's actually working — not what you assumed would work.

## Post 2: Sales Cycle Math

```
"How long until I see results?"

I get this question on every call. The honest answer: it depends on who you're selling to.

From what I've seen:

→ SMB: 30-45 days from first touch to close
→ Mid-market: About 3 months
→ Enterprise: 6+ months, sometimes 12

None of these are bad. They're just different math.

A 6-month sales cycle for a $500K deal? That's $83K/month in expected value. Worth it.

A 6-month sales cycle for a $5K deal? That's $833/month. Probably not.

The mistake I see: companies chasing enterprise logos with SMB resources. Or closing SMB deals with enterprise-level effort.

Match your sales motion to the deal size. If the math doesn't work, change the motion or change the market.

## Post 3: The 90-Day Reality

```
New clients ask: "When will I see results?"

Here's the honest timeline:

**Days 1-30: Infrastructure**
→ Domain setup, email warm-up, tool configuration
→ ICP definition, list building, message testing
→ Nothing is live yet. This is the unglamorous part.

**Days 30-60: Learning**
→ Campaigns go live
→ We see what resonates and what doesn't
→ Open rates, reply rates, meeting conversion — gathering data

**Days 60-90: Pipeline**
→ Conversations turn into qualified opportunities
→ The feedback loop is working
→ We know what to double down on

Anyone promising results in 2 weeks is skipping the infrastructure. That catches up with you — deliverability issues, burned domains, wasted spend.

Outbound isn't a quick fix. It's a system. Systems take time to build.
```

**Status:** Ready — real framework
**Data source:** Actual client onboarding process

---

## Post 4: Signal-Based Prospecting

```
Most outbound runs on stale lists.

Download a database. Filter by industry and headcount. Blast the same message to everyone.

There's a better way: reach out when something relevant happens.

→ A company announces an acquisition. Their ops team is about to get overwhelmed.
→ A new VP of Sales gets hired. They have 90 days to prove themselves.
→ A company opens a new office. They need vendors in that market.

Same company, different timing. The message lands completely differently.

How we do it:

We connect RSS feeds — BusinessWire, PR Newswire, industry sources — to our prospecting tools. When a trigger fires, that company enters a sequence.

The email references what just happened. It's relevant. It's timely.

Intent data is expensive. Triggers are free if you set up the pipes.
```

**Status:** Ready — real method
**Data source:** Actual prospecting workflow

---

## Post 5: Strategy + Execution

```
I've sat in a lot of strategy presentations.

Beautiful slides. Market analysis. Positioning frameworks. Recommended next steps.

Then the consultant leaves and the deck collects dust.

I've also seen the opposite: teams cranking out campaigns with no coherent strategy. Random acts of marketing.

Both fail.

Strategy and execution aren't separate functions. They're a feedback loop.

→ Strategy informs what we execute
→ Execution data informs strategy updates
→ The plan changes based on what works

When they're split across different teams — or different vendors — the loop breaks. The strategist doesn't see the data. The executor doesn't understand the intent.

The best operators hold both. They can zoom out to the market and zoom in to the email subject line.

That's what we do. Strategy and execution. Same team, same context.
```

**Status:** Ready — key differentiator
**Data source:** Actual positioning/experience

## Post 6: The 25 Free Leads Offer

```
When I meet a company for the first time, I don't pitch.

I offer to build them a list.

25 companies that match their ideal client profile. Names, titles, contact info. Theirs to keep, no strings attached.

Why give it away?

1. It shows I understand their market. If the list is garbage, they know immediately. If it's good, they trust the process.

2. It starts a real conversation. Instead of talking hypotheticals, we're looking at actual targets together.

3. It filters fast. Some people take the list and disappear. That's fine — they weren't going to buy anyway.

A free list isn't charity. It's the fastest way to see if we're a fit.

If you want 25 leads for your business, send me a message with your ICP. I'll build the list this week.
```

## Post 7: The Post-Raise Infrastructure Gap

```
You just raised your Series A. Congrats.

Here's what usually happens next:

→ Hire 2-3 AEs
→ Give them a CRM login and a target
→ Wonder why pipeline isn't building fast enough

The AEs aren't the problem. The infrastructure is.

No scoring model. No enrichment. No way to know which accounts to prioritize tomorrow morning. No dashboards showing what's working.

So your AEs, the people you're paying to sell, spend half their day figuring out who to call and manually researching accounts.

That's not a sales problem. It's a foundation problem.

The companies I've seen ramp fastest after a raise? They build the infrastructure first, then point people at it.

CRM configured for your ICP. Enrichment running automatically. Scoring that tells reps where to focus. Dashboards that show pipeline by source and stage.

It takes about 30 days. And it changes everything about how fast your team gets productive.
```

**Based on:** Infrastructure gap positioning
**Notes:** Observation post. No fabricated stats. Targets Series A/B founders post-raise.

---

## Post 8: Your AEs Aren't Underperforming

```
Your AEs aren't underperforming.

They're doing two jobs.

At most early-stage SaaS companies, AEs are full-cycle. They prospect, qualify, demo, negotiate, and close.

But they're also:

→ Researching accounts manually
→ Guessing which companies to prioritize
→ Cleaning up CRM data
→ Building their own target lists
→ Trying to figure out if a lead is actually a fit

That's not selling. That's operations work.

And it's expensive. If an AE spends even a third of their time on ops tasks, you're paying senior sales comp for junior ops work.

The fix isn't hiring more AEs. It's building the layer underneath them.

Account scoring so they know who to call first. Enrichment so the data is already there. Reporting so they can see what's converting and what isn't.

Most founders I talk to don't think of this as a separate problem. They think their team just needs to "ramp up."

The team is fine. The foundation is missing.

## Post 9: Your RevOps Hire Will Fail Without This

```
Saw something this week that I see all the time:

Series B SaaS company. Growing fast. Posted a job for their first Head of RevOps.

Great move. But here's what usually happens:

→ New hire starts
→ Spends month 1 auditing what exists (not much)
→ Spends months 2-3 choosing tools and building from scratch
→ Spends months 4-6 getting buy-in and rolling things out
→ Board starts asking why pipeline metrics haven't improved yet

Six months in, you're just getting to baseline.

What if that person walked into infrastructure that already worked?

Scoring model live. Enrichment running. CRM configured properly. Dashboards reporting on pipeline.

Now their job is optimization, not construction. They're tuning a system on day one instead of building one from zero.

Most companies hire the person first and hope they'll build the foundation. The ones that move fastest build the foundation first and hire someone to run it.

## Post 10: What a RevOps Infrastructure Build Actually Includes

```
"RevOps infrastructure" sounds vague.

Here's what it actually means. The stuff that should exist before you scale your sales team:

ICP scoring model
Not a slide deck defining your ideal customer. An actual model in your CRM that scores every account based on fit signals. Your reps open their dashboard and know exactly who to prioritize.

Enrichment workflows
New lead comes in, automatically enriched with company size, tech stack, funding status, decision maker contacts. No manual research. No Googling.

CRM configuration
Pipelines, stages, fields, and properties that match how your team actually sells. Not the default HubSpot setup with 47 unused fields.

Reporting dashboards
Pipeline by source. Conversion by stage. Activity metrics that tell you if the inputs are right, not just if the outputs happened.

That's the foundation. It takes about 30 days to build. And it's the difference between a team that's guessing and a team that's executing with clarity.

None of this is fancy. It's just the infrastructure most companies skip because it's not as exciting as hiring another AE.

## Post 11: Your CRM Isn't a Database

```
Most companies treat their CRM like a filing cabinet.

Contacts go in. Notes get added. Maybe someone updates a deal stage once a week.

That's not a CRM. That's a spreadsheet with a login screen.

A CRM should be a decision engine. It should tell your team:

→ Which accounts to call first (scoring)
→ What to say when they call (enriched context)
→ Whether the pipeline is healthy or not (reporting)
→ Where deals are stalling (stage analysis)

When I look at most early-stage CRMs, I see the same thing: thousands of contacts, no scoring, no enrichment, default pipeline stages that don't match how the team actually sells.

The tool isn't the problem. The configuration is.

A well-configured CRM doesn't just store data. It drives behavior. Your reps open it Monday morning and know exactly what to do.

That's the difference between a $50/month expense and a $50/month investment.
```

**Status:** Draft - needs review
**Based on:** CRM as decision engine
**Notes:** Contrarian reframe. Applies to any CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce). Practical.

## Post 12: The First Thing I Check in Any CRM

```
When I look at a company's CRM for the first time, I check one thing before anything else.

How many fields are actually being used?

Not how many fields exist. How many have data in them. Consistently.

Most early-stage CRMs have 40-60 fields. Maybe 8-10 are filled in regularly. The rest are empty, leftover from a setup guide someone followed six months ago.

Here's why this matters:

Empty fields mean your reps are doing manual research somewhere else. They're Googling companies, checking LinkedIn, pulling up Crunchbase. All to get context they should already have.

Full fields mean enrichment is working. Data flows in automatically. Reps spend their time selling, not researching.

The gap between those two states is usually 3-5 automated workflows.

If your CRM has more empty fields than full ones, you don't have a CRM problem. You have an enrichment problem.
```

**Based on:** Operator perspective / behind-the-scenes
**Notes:** "First thing I check" format builds credibility through specificity.

---

## Post 13: What Enrichment Actually Does

```
"Enrichment" sounds like a buzzword.

Here's what it actually means for a sales team.

Before enrichment:
→ New lead comes in with a name and email
→ AE Googles the company
→ Checks LinkedIn for the person's title
→ Looks up funding status on Crunchbase
→ Tries to figure out company size
→ 15 minutes later, they might know if it's worth a call

After enrichment:
→ New lead comes in with a name and email
→ Within seconds: company size, tech stack, funding round, decision maker titles, industry, and a fit score
→ AE sees the score and context. Makes a call or moves on.
→ 15 seconds, not 15 minutes

Multiply that by 50 leads a week.

Before: 12+ hours of research. After: minutes.

That's not a nice-to-have. That's the difference between an AE who books 3 meetings a week and one who books 10.

The tools to do this exist. Clay, Clearbit, Apollo. The missing piece is usually the workflows that connect them to your CRM automatically.
```

**Notes:** Before/after format makes abstract concept concrete. Real tools named.

## Post 14: You Don't Have a Pipeline Problem

```
"We need more pipeline."

I hear this from almost every founder I talk to.

And almost every time, the real problem isn't volume. It's visibility.

They have leads coming in. Reps are having conversations. Deals are moving. But nobody can see:

→ Which sources are producing qualified pipeline (not just leads)
→ Where deals stall in the funnel
→ Which rep activities actually correlate with closed deals
→ Whether this month's pipeline will hit next quarter's target

So the default answer is "more." More leads. More AEs. More campaigns.

But more of what's already broken just breaks faster.

Before you add volume, build the reporting layer. Know what's working. Know what's not. Then scale the things that convert and cut the things that don't.

Most founders I talk to are surprised by what the data shows. The channel they thought was working isn't. The one they ignored is producing their best deals.

You can't optimize what you can't see.

**Notes:** Observation post. Challenges the "more pipeline" reflex. Positions reporting as the real fix.

## Post 15: Three Questions Your Dashboard Should Answer Monday Morning

```
Most sales dashboards are built for board meetings. Not for Monday mornings.

Board dashboards show trailing indicators. Revenue. Win rates. Average deal size. Useful for reporting, not for deciding what to do this week.

Here are three questions your dashboard should answer every Monday:

1. Are we creating enough new pipeline to hit next quarter's number?

Not this quarter. Next quarter. If the answer is no, you need to know now, not in 90 days.

2. Where are deals stuck?

Deals sitting in the same stage for 2x the average? That's a signal. Either the deal is dead or the rep needs help. Both require action.

3. Which activities are producing meetings?

Not which channels produced the most leads. Which activities produced the most qualified meetings. There's a difference.

If your dashboard can't answer these three questions in under 60 seconds, it's a report, not a tool.

Dashboards should drive decisions, not just document results.

## Post 16: I Scored 1,644 Companies Using Only Public Data

```
Last week I built an account scoring model for a client. No CRM access. No proprietary data. Just public information.

Here's what I did:

Pulled 5,000 contract awards from a government spending database. Filtered by industry. Aggregated by company.

Then scored each company on four factors:
→ Contract value (are they in the right size range?)
→ Award volume (how active is their pipeline?)
→ Agency diversity (do they work across multiple buyers?)
→ Recency (are they winning contracts now, not two years ago?)

Result: 1,644 companies scored. 18 came out as Tier A. High fit, active pipeline, right size, recent wins.

Those 18 accounts are specific enough to call this week. Not a vague list of "companies in the industry." Ranked, scored, and prioritized.

The point isn't the specific model. It's that account scoring doesn't require expensive tools or months of setup. It requires clear criteria and the right data.

If you can define what makes a good customer, you can build a scoring model. And your team stops guessing who to call.

## Post 17: The $18K Question

```
"Should I just hire someone to set this up?"

Founders ask me this all the time. And honestly, sometimes the answer is yes.

Here's how I think about it:

Hire internally if:
→ You have 6+ months to get it right
→ You can afford a $120K+ salary for a RevOps person
→ You have enough work to keep them busy full-time after setup
→ You're okay with trial and error during ramp-up

Bring in outside help if:
→ You need it done in 30 days
→ Your AEs are already underwater and can't wait
→ You don't have enough ongoing ops work to justify a full-time hire yet
→ You want someone who's built this before and knows the shortcuts

An infrastructure build isn't a permanent engagement. It's a project. 30 days, clearly scoped, then your team runs it.

Not every company needs outside help. But if your team is growing faster than your systems, the math usually favors speed.

## Post 18: Why I Build GTM Infrastructure

```
Five years in corporate FP&A taught me one thing that shapes everything I do now.

The companies that hit their numbers weren't the ones with the best salespeople. They were the ones with the best systems.

Forecasts that were actually accurate. Data that was clean. Reports that told you what to do, not just what happened.

The companies that missed? Talented people flying blind. Great sellers working off gut feel because nobody built the infrastructure to support them.

When I started working with startups, I saw the same pattern. Founders hire AEs and expect pipeline to follow. Sometimes it does. Usually it doesn't.

Not because the team is bad. Because the foundation is missing.

That's what I build. The scoring models, enrichment workflows, CRM configuration, and reporting dashboards that turn a CRM from a contact database into a system that drives revenue.

It's not the exciting part of sales. Nobody posts on LinkedIn about their enrichment workflows.

But it's the part that makes everything else work.
