# Email Draft: Voice Brain PVP

**To:** Keegan Burchard (Voice Brain)  
**From:** Scott Davidson  
**Subject:** SLED radio procurement intel - systems deploying now

---

Hey Keegan,

Hope things are going well with Voice Brain! I remembered from our last conversation that you're targeting SLED governments procuring new radio equipment. Had some downtime this weekend and spent a couple hours digging through public procurement databases (SAM.gov, state portals, grant programs) to see what's out there.

Thought I'd share what I found - figured it might be useful as you scale into the SLED market.

## TL;DR

Found $700M+ in P25 radio projects awarded/funded in 2024. The interesting part: most are being **deployed RIGHT NOW** (Q4 2025/Q1 2026), which creates a perfect window for AI transcription add-ons rather than having to compete in complex RFPs.

## Top 3 Opportunities (Systems Deploying Now)

### 1. Texas Emergency Radio Infrastructure Grant - $20M ⭐
**Why it's urgent:** Projects MUST complete by August 31, 2026 (9 months away). Agencies are mid-deployment right now.

- Grant funded 10-20 Regional Councils of Governments and state agencies
- All systems must be P25-compliant (non-negotiable requirement)
- Funding range: $10K to $2M per project
- **Action:** Contact Texas Office of the Governor to request recipient list, reach out to COGs/agencies mid-deployment
- **Pitch angle:** "Add AI transcription before project closeout"

### 2. Cumberland County PA Regional System - $15-30M (4 counties) ⭐
**Why it's huge:** One engagement = four counties

- 4-county regional system: Cumberland, Dauphin, Adams, Franklin (South-Central Inter-County Communications Network)
- Motorola ASTRO P25 Phase II Trunked 800 MHz
- Timeline: Going live Q4 2025/Q1 2026 (literally deploying right now)
- **Action:** Contact Cumberland County Emergency Management ASAP
- **Pitch angle:** "Launch your new system with AI transcription from day one"

### 3. New York SICG Grant Program - $40M
**Why it matters:** Pre-qualified agencies with secured funding

- $40M allocated to counties/municipalities for P25 Phase 1 or Phase 2 systems
- Grant questions closed June 4, 2025 - systems now deploying through 2026
- **Action:** Contact NY DHSES for grant recipient list
- **Pitch angle:** "Phase 2 enhancement for your grant-funded P25 upgrade"

## Secondary Opportunities (Post-Deployment Add-Ons)

### Florida Statewide Law Enforcement Radio System - $450M
- L3Harris contract awarded 2024, completion targeted late 2024/early 2025
- Systems likely operational or nearly complete
- Contact: Florida DMS Public Safety Communications Division
- Angle: "Phase 2 enhancement - AI transcription for your new statewide system"

### Miami-Dade County - $165M
- Motorola contract awarded Oct 2024
- APX NEXT mobile/portable radios for police and fire
- Systems likely deployed or in final phase
- Contact: Miami-Dade IT/Public Safety

### Montgomery County - $42M
- Motorola system launched 2024
- 8,000 active radios (Fire & Rescue, Police, 911, Sheriff, Corrections)
- 10-year maintenance contract = long-term relationship opportunity

---

## Federal Opportunities (SAM.gov)

Found 6 active federal LMR solicitations on SAM.gov:
- OSS Land Mobile Radios (LMR)
- Land Mobile Radio (LMR) Tech Refresh
- Enterprise Land Mobile Radio (ELMR) System
- LMR Maintenance and Repair
- L3 Harris LMR Equipment & Installation
- LMR Infrastructure Maintenance

You'd need to create a free SAM.gov account to see full details/deadlines, but these are live federal opportunities right now.

## Why This Timing Works

Most of these RFPs closed in early-mid 2025, but that's actually **better** than catching them during the RFP phase because:

1. **No competitive bid process** - agencies have already selected vendors
2. **Mid-deployment engagement** - systems being built right now, easier to add features
3. **Budget already allocated** - no "we'll think about it" - they have funding
4. **Deadline pressure** - grant recipients especially need to complete by specific dates
5. **"Phase 2" positioning** - easier sell than competing in original RFP

The play is: "You've got this awesome new P25 system deploying - add AI transcription as a Phase 2 enhancement before project closeout."

## Quick Data Sources (If You Want to Monitor Ongoing)

- **SAM.gov** (federal): Free account, set up alerts for "P25", "LMR", "public safety radio"
- **State portals**: Texas (txsmartbuy.com), California (caleprocure.ca.gov), Florida (myfloridamarketplace.com)
- **PublicPurchase.com**: Aggregates state/local RFPs (free basic access)
- **BidNet/InstantMarkets**: Commercial aggregators (~$100-300/month if you want comprehensive coverage)

---

No strings attached - just thought this could help accelerate your SLED pipeline. If it's useful and you want to systematically monitor this stuff going forward, happy to show you how I'd set that up (Clay workflow + alerts takes like 3-4 hours to build).

Either way, hope this gives you some good leads!

Best,
Scott

**P.S.** - The Texas grant recipients are the highest priority IMO. They have 9 months to deploy systems, which means they're making decisions **right now** about what features to include. Perfect timing to get AI transcription in before August 2026 deadline.
