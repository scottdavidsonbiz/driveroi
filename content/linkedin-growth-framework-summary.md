## Executive Summary

Adam Robinson grew from 0 to 100,000 LinkedIn followers in 18 months using a systematic 6-step framework. This summary distills the key principles and provides specific applications for Drive ROI's content strategy in the GTM consulting space.

---

## The 6-Step Framework

### Step 1: Develop Your Story
**Core Principle:** Make your target market feel seen by clearly articulating who you are, the niche you serve, and what you stand for.

**Key Insights:**
- Your story should resonate with your ICP's pain points
- Be explicit about who you help and what transformation you provide
- Stand for something specific, not everything to everyone

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Who we are:** RevOps + FP&A experts who modernize GTM for founder-led businesses and finance SaaS companies
- **Niche we serve:** PE portfolio companies (20-100 employees), finance/accounting SaaS, founder-led legacy services businesses
- **What we stand for:** Data-driven GTM automation that replaces spray-and-pray tactics with systematic, measurable growth
- **Story angle:** "Most RevOps consultants don't understand finance. Most finance people don't understand modern GTM. We bridge both worlds."

---

### Step 2: Perfect Your Profile
**Core Principle:** Maximize professional credibility through strategic profile optimization.

**Key Elements:**
- Headline: Not just title, but value proposition
- About section: Clear problem → solution → proof
- Featured section: Case studies, testimonials, key content
- Experience: Frame as outcomes, not just responsibilities

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Headline idea:** "RevOps + FP&A → I help PE-backed SaaS and founder-led businesses build revenue operations infrastructure that boards love | Ex-6sense"
- **About section focus:** 
  - Problem: Manual GTM, messy data, no board-ready analytics
  - Solution: Complete revenue operations (strategy + automation + analytics)
  - Proof: Brenda's PE portfolio work + your FP&A background
- **Featured content:** Partnership positioning doc, case studies from IVS/Voice Brain once closed

---

### Step 3: System for Creating Best-in-Class Content
**Core Principle:** Consistent content creation system using proven frameworks.

**Key Tactics:**
- Study successful creators in your niche (model, don't copy)
- Use frameworks: Prolific Index (unique insights + mainstream ideas)
- Post consistently (daily for rapid growth, 3-5x/week for sustainable)
- Mix content types: insights, stories, tactical how-tos

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Content pillars:**
  1. **RevOps Strategy** - ICP definition, territory planning, capacity modeling
  2. **GTM Automation** - Clay workflows, intent data, sequencing tactics
  3. **Revenue Analytics** - Pipeline forecasting, board reporting, KPI frameworks
  4. **Finance + GTM** - How FP&A thinking improves revenue operations
  5. **Founder Stories** - Lessons from modernizing legacy businesses
  
- **Content format ideas:**
  - **Monday:** Tactical tip (e.g., "How to build a Clay waterfall in 5 minutes")
  - **Wednesday:** Insight from client work (anonymized lessons from IVS, Voice Brain)
  - **Friday:** Industry observation (e.g., "Why PE firms are finally prioritizing RevOps")
  
- **Unique angle (Prolific Index):** 
  - Mainstream: "You need a CRM"
  - Unique: "Most SaaS companies use CRMs built for yesterday's playbook. Here's how PE portfolios are rebuilding from scratch with AI-first infrastructure."

---

### Step 4: Growth Strategies & Tactics
**Core Principle:** Strategic engagement and connection campaigns to accelerate growth.

**Key Tactics:**
- **Connect campaigns:** Target 100-250 ideal prospects, engage with their content before connecting
- **Engagement strategy:** Comment meaningfully on influencer posts to get visibility
- **DM strategy:** Provide value first, ask for nothing
- **Collaboration:** Tag relevant people, amplify others' content

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Target connections:**
  - PE firm partners and operating partners
  - CROs/VPs RevOps at Series B+ SaaS (especially finance/accounting vertical)
  - Founders of 15-50 person services businesses in professional services
  
- **Engagement targets (comment on their posts):**
  - PE firms: EigenRev, other portfolio operators
  - RevOps influencers: Pavilion leaders, Winning by Design folks
  - Finance SaaS leaders: Treasury Hub CEO, other fintech founders
  
- **Connection message template:**
  "Hi [Name], I've been following your insights on [topic]. As someone who combines RevOps + FP&A background, I'm particularly interested in how PE portfolios are approaching revenue operations. Would love to connect and learn from your experience."

- **Value-first DM ideas:**
  - Share relevant case study when PE firm posts about portfolio challenges
  - Offer free 30-min audit of LinkedIn profile/GTM approach
  - Send summary of key RevOps metrics their portfolio companies should track

---

### Step 5: Build Community Through Commenting
**Core Principle:** Use strategic commenting to build relationships that move off-platform.

**Key Insights:**
- Comment early on posts from your ICP (first 2 hours = maximum visibility)
- Provide thoughtful, value-adding comments (not just "Great post!")
- Build relationships in comments, then move to DMs, then calls
- Create a "commenting list" of 50-100 ideal prospects and engage regularly

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Commenting strategy:**
  1. Set up LinkedIn notifications for key PE partners and target prospects
  2. Aim for 10-15 meaningful comments per day
  3. Comment framework: Agree + Add unique insight + Ask question
  
- **Example comment on PE firm post about portfolio growth:**
  "This resonates. We're seeing the same pattern with Series B companies - they have the CRM but not the analytics infrastructure. The disconnect between GTM data and board reporting creates massive blind spots. Curious how you're approaching this with your portfolio - are you standardizing RevOps frameworks across companies or letting each find their own path?"

- **Move off-platform:**
  - After 3-5 quality interactions: DM with specific value offer
  - After positive DM exchange: Propose brief call to share insights
  - Goal: Turn 10-15 LinkedIn connections into 3-5 discovery calls per month

---

### Step 6: Use Video for Deeper Connection
**Core Principle:** Video creates deeper human-to-human connection and trust.

**Key Tactics:**
- Start with simple: phone camera, natural lighting
- Short form (30-90 seconds) performs well on LinkedIn
- Repurpose longer content into clips
- Don't overthink production quality early on

**Application to Drive ROI:**
- **Phase 1 (Q1 2025):** Focus on written content to establish expertise
- **Phase 2 (Q2 2025):** Add video once written content is working
  
- **Video content ideas when ready:**
  - **Tool tutorials:** "Here's how I built this Clay workflow in 3 minutes"
  - **Behind the scenes:** Screen recordings of building dashboards, workflows
  - **Client wins:** "Just helped a founder-led business 3x their pipeline in 6 weeks - here's what we did"
  - **Hot takes:** Video reactions to industry news, LinkedIn trends
  
- **Video format:**
  - Keep under 2 minutes
  - Hook in first 3 seconds: "I just analyzed 50 Series B SaaS RevOps teams and found something surprising..."
  - End with clear CTA: DM me for the full framework

---

## Resources & Tools

- **Connection Tracking:** Simple spreadsheet with columns: Name, Company, Stage, Notes, Last Touch

---

## Final Thoughts: Why This Will Work for Drive ROI

Adam Robinson's framework works because it's systematic, not random. You're not hoping for virality - you're building:

1. **Clear positioning** (who you help, how you're different)
2. **Consistent visibility** (posting + commenting = algorithm loves you)
3. **Relationship building** (engagement → connections → conversations → calls)
4. **Proof points** (case studies feed content feed more clients)

Your advantage: Most RevOps consultants can't talk about finance. Most finance consultants don't do RevOps. You do both. That unique POV + consistent execution = LinkedIn becomes a lead generation machine.

**The goal isn't 100K followers.** The goal is 100 *qualified* connections that turn into 10 discovery calls that turn into 3 clients. Do that consistently, and you have a business.
