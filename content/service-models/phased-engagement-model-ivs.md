# Service Model: Phased Engagement (Phase 1 → Phase 2 Optional)

## Service Model Overview
Two-phase engagement structure: Foundation (Phase 1, required) → Scale (Phase 2, optional based on results).

**Key principle:** Test → Validate → Scale (low commitment upfront, expand if working)

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Required)

### Duration
**3 months minimum**

**Why 3 months:**
- Week 1-2: Strategic foundation (ICP, messaging, segmentation)
- Week 3-8: Campaign execution (launch, monitor, iterate)
- Week 9-12: Optimization (A/B testing, refinement, bi-weekly reviews)

**Rationale:** Less than 3 months = not enough time to launch + iterate + validate approach

---

### Pricing (IVS Example)
**Service fee:** $4,000/month
**Infrastructure:** $500-600/month (client-owned tools)
**Total:** $4,500-4,600/month
**3-month commitment:** $13,500-13,800 total

**Payment structure:**
- 50% upfront (upon contract signature)
- 25% at Month 2
- 25% at Month 3

**Exit clause:** 30-day notice after 3-month minimum

---

### Deliverables

**Strategic Foundation (Week 1-2):**
1. **ICP definition document**
   - Industries, company sizes, personas
   - Intent signals to monitor
   - Account scoring criteria

2. **Account list creation**
   - Initial target accounts (500-1,000)
   - Scored and prioritized (ICP fit + intent signals)
   - Segmented by industry, persona, intent level

3. **Messaging frameworks**
   - Email templates (personalized, short, professional)
   - LinkedIn message sequences
   - Intent-based personalization variables

4. **Intent signal monitoring setup**
   - Job changes (LinkedIn, Clay)
   - 10K filings (if applicable)
   - Website visitors (first-party tracking)
   - Third-party intent (ZoomInfo, if available)

**Campaign Execution (Week 3+):**
5. **Campaign launches**
   - LinkedIn outbound (connection requests, messaging sequences)
   - Email outbound (multi-step sequences, A/B testing)
   - Volume: 25 LinkedIn connections/day per account, email as appropriate

6. **Bi-weekly strategy calls**
   - Review metrics (reply rates, meeting rates, conversion)
   - Discuss learnings, hypotheses, optimizations
   - Iterate messaging, targeting, approach

7. **Weekly async reporting**
   - Reply rates by message variant
   - Meeting booking rates
   - Hypotheses tested
   - Next week's plan

---

### Infrastructure (Client-Owned)

**Why client owns:**
- No vendor lock-in (can continue without Scott if needed)
- Transparent costs (see exactly what tools cost)
- Capability building (learning how to run campaigns)

**Tools setup:**
- **Clay** ($350/month) - Data enrichment, workflow orchestration
- **Hey Reach** ($79/month per LinkedIn account) - LinkedIn automation
- **instantly.ai** ($97/month) - Email automation, unified inbox
- **Make.com** ($11/month) - Workflow automation, routing
- **Email domains/inboxes** (~$100/month) - Multiple domains for deliverability

**Total infrastructure:** $500-600/month (IVS: 3-4 LinkedIn accounts)

**Setup support:**
- Joint account creation call
- Scott gets access (via 1Password or similar)
- Client retains ownership
- Scott manages execution

---

### Success Metrics (Phase 1)

**Benchmark expectations:**
- **LinkedIn reply rate:** 20-30% (IVS benchmark)
- **Email reply rate:** 5-10%
- **Meetings per 500 contacts:** 1+ (conservative baseline)

**By end of Phase 1 (Month 3), client should know:**
1. **Does this approach work for our industry?** (Reply rates acceptable?)
2. **Are we getting qualified meetings?** (Not just volume, but quality)
3. **What's our ICP "bulls-eye"?** (Which segments convert best?)
4. **Should we scale this?** (Continue to Phase 2 or exit)

---

## Phase 2: Scale (Optional)

### Duration
**Ongoing (month-to-month or annual contract)**

### Decision Point
**End of Phase 1:** Evaluate if ready for Phase 2

**Criteria:**
1. **✅ Top-of-funnel qualified pipeline exists:** Phase 1 generated meetings, not just replies
2. **✅ Issues beyond qualification:** Discovery, conversion, deal velocity need improvement
3. **✅ Ready to scale:** More volume, more sophisticated workflows, CRM needed

**If NO to above:** Either exit or extend Phase 1 (iterate more before scaling)

---

### Pricing (IVS Example)
**Service fee:** $5,500/month (increased scope)

**Why higher:**
- CRM implementation + management
- Advanced workflow automation
- Conversion optimization (beyond top-of-funnel)
- Social listening / monitoring
- More hands-on involvement

---

### Additional Deliverables (Phase 2)

**1. CRM Implementation**
- Tool: Attio (IVS example - $20-25/seat)
- Setup: Pipeline stages, fields, automations
- Integration: Clay → CRM, email → CRM, LinkedIn → CRM
- Training: Team onboarding, usage best practices

**2. Workflow Automation**
- Advanced Make.com/Zapier workflows
- Lead routing (qualified leads → CRM → sales rep)
- Follow-up sequences (automated based on engagement)
- Notification systems (Slack, email alerts for hot leads)

**3. Social Listening**
- Tool: Triggerify ($100-150/month) or similar
- Monitor: Competitor mentions, industry keywords, buying signals
- Alerts: Real-time notifications for high-intent prospects
- Engagement: Automated responses, relationship building

**4. Discovery Methodology Refinement**
- Frameworks: BANT, MEDIC, custom qualification
- Call scripts: Discovery call structure, qualification questions
- Objection handling: Playbooks for common objections
- Sales enablement: Training for internal team

**5. Conversion Optimization**
- Funnel analysis: Where are prospects dropping off?
- Bottleneck identification: Qualification? Discovery? Proposal? Close?
- A/B testing: Proposal formats, pricing structures, value propositions
- Iteration: Systematic improvement of conversion rates

---

### Success Metrics (Phase 2)

**Beyond reply rates:**
- **Discovery-to-qualified:** % of discovery calls that become qualified pipeline
- **Qualified-to-proposal:** % of qualified prospects that receive proposals
- **Proposal-to-close:** % of proposals that close into deals
- **Deal velocity:** Average days from first contact to close
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Total spend ÷ customers acquired

**By end of Phase 2 (6-12 months total), client should have:**
1. **Fully validated playbook:** ICP + messaging + conversion process proven
2. **Systematic pipeline generation:** Predictable flow of qualified opportunities
3. **Optimized conversion:** Bottlenecks identified and addressed
4. **Scalable infrastructure:** Can continue without Scott (if desired)

---

## Why This Model Works

### For the Client (IVS)

**1. Low commitment upfront**
- 3 months to test (not 12-month contract)
- Can exit after 3 months if not working
- Own infrastructure (not locked into vendor)

**2. De-risked investment**
- Test Phase 1 before committing to Phase 2
- See results before scaling spend
- Clear decision point (end of Month 3)

**3. Flexible scaling**
- Phase 2 is optional (based on Phase 1 results)
- Can extend Phase 1 instead of jumping to Phase 2
- Month-to-month or annual (client choice)

**4. Ownership model**
- Client owns all tools/accounts
- Can continue without Scott (capability built)
- No vendor lock-in (infrastructure remains if Scott leaves)

**5. Transparency**
- Bi-weekly strategy calls (full visibility)
- Weekly async reports (see what's happening)
- Not a black box (understand how it works)

---

### For Scott (Service Provider)

**1. Easier to sell**
- Lower commitment = less objection ("just 3 months")
- Safety net = addresses risk aversion
- Ownership model = addresses vendor lock-in concern

**2. Qualification mechanism**
- Phase 1 tests if client is good fit
- If they're not, exit after 3 months (no long-term commitment to bad client)
- If they are, expand to Phase 2 (grow revenue)

**3. Upsell path**
- Phase 1 → Phase 2 = natural expansion (not new sale)
- Proven results = easier to sell Phase 2
- Higher monthly revenue (Phase 2 = $5.5K vs. Phase 1 = $4K)

**4. Client success focus**
- Forced to deliver in 3 months (can't hide behind annual contract)
- Clear success metrics (reply rates, meetings, qualified pipeline)
- Accountability = builds reputation

---

## IVS Pricing Justification

### Phase 1 ROI Math

**Client need:** $400K new business annually (IVS target)
**Average deal:** $50K per contract
**Deals needed:** 8-10 contracts/year

**Investment:**
- Service: $4K/month × 3 = $12K
- Infrastructure: $550/month × 3 = $1,650
- **Total:** $13,650 (3 months)

**ROI if just ONE deal closes:**
- Revenue: $50K
- Cost: $13,650
- **ROI:** 3.66x (or 266% return)

**If TWO deals close:**
- Revenue: $100K
- Cost: $13,650
- **ROI:** 7.33x (or 633% return)

**Break-even:** 0.27 deals (27% of one deal = $13,650)

**Conclusion:** If Phase 1 generates even a fraction of a deal, it's paid for itself.

---

### Phase 2 ROI Math

**Assumption:** Phase 1 generated qualified pipeline (meetings booked, discovery calls happening)

**Phase 2 goal:** Convert pipeline into closed deals

**Investment:**
- Service: $5.5K/month × 6 months = $33K (assuming 6-month Phase 2)
- Infrastructure: (same as Phase 1, already owned)
- **Total:** $33K additional (Phase 2 only)

**ROI if Phase 2 closes 2-3 deals:**
- Revenue: $100-150K (2-3 deals × $50K)
- Cost: $33K (Phase 2) + $13,650 (Phase 1) = $46,650 total
- **ROI:** 2.14x - 3.22x (114% - 222% return)

**Conclusion:** Even conservative close rates make Phase 2 highly profitable.

---

## Pattern Status

**Validation Count:** 1 client (IVS Tax Services - phased engagement accepted)

**Status:** Hypothesis (need 2 more clients to validate)

**Next Validations:**
- [ ] Client 2: Do they also prefer phased approach over annual contract?
- [ ] Client 3: Does this model close deals faster / reduce objections?
- [ ] If YES to both → Promote to **Pattern: "Phased engagement = lower friction, higher close rate"**

**What to test:**
- Does phased structure reduce sales cycle length?
- Does ownership model address vendor lock-in objection?
- Does Phase 1 → Phase 2 upsell work in practice?
- What % of Phase 1 clients continue to Phase 2?

---

## When to Use This Model

### Strong Fit For:
- ✅ **Risk-averse clients** (professional services, regulated industries)
- ✅ **Multi-stakeholder decisions** (need to "prove it" before full commitment)
- ✅ **Skeptical buyers** (been burned before, need safety net)
- ✅ **New relationship** (no prior trust, need to build it)

### Weak Fit For:
- ❌ **Urgent needs** (need results in < 3 months, no time for phased approach)
- ❌ **Already trusting** (existing client, no need for low-commitment test)
- ❌ **Price-sensitive** (monthly pricing adds up, annual might be cheaper)
