# Buying Trigger: Competitor Growth Comparison

## The Trigger
Company watches competitors grow while they plateau—creating competitive pressure and fear of falling behind.

---

## How to Identify It

### IVS Tax Services Example

**Signal (Implied):**
> "Post-COVID, we've been stagnant" + "Current marketer makes excuses"

**What wasn't said explicitly but implied:**
- Competitors aren't stagnant (IVS sees them winning)
- Market is growing (others capturing share IVS isn't)
- IVS losing relative position (even if absolute revenue flat)

**Discovery Context:**
- Jeffrey frustrated with lack of growth
- Mentioned competitors (not specifically, but awareness of market)
- Urgency to act (tax season) suggests competitive threat

---

## Why This Creates Urgency

### FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- **Competitors growing** = They're capturing share we're not
- **Market opportunity exists** (others proving it)
- **We're falling behind** (relative loss, even if absolute flat)

### Social Proof (Reversed)
- **Social proof normally:** "Others use this, so should we"
- **Reversed here:** "Others are winning with [approach], we're losing with [our approach]"
- **Implication:** Need to change approach to catch up

### Identity Threat (Competitive)
- **Pride:** "We're a 26-year established firm" (we should be winning)
- **Reality:** Competitors growing faster (we're not as competitive as we thought)
- **Dissonance:** "Why are they succeeding while we plateau?"

### Strategic Risk
- **Market share loss:** Competitors gaining = harder to win back later
- **Customer perception:** "Why aren't they growing like [competitor]?"
- **Talent retention:** Top performers want to join winning companies

---

## Buying Trigger Formula

```
Stagnation (our growth)
+ Competitor growth (their success)
= Competitive pressure + FOMO
= Urgency to act
```

---

## How to Leverage This Trigger

### In Prospecting

**Identify companies with visible competitive disadvantage:**
- **LinkedIn signals:**
  - Competitor announces expansion, hiring surge, funding
  - Target company quiet (no announcements)
- **Job postings:**
  - Competitors hiring (growth mode)
  - Target company not hiring (stagnant)
- **News:**
  - Competitor wins awards, recognition
  - Target company missing from industry conversations
- **Intent data:**
  - Competitor mentions (searching for competitor info)
  - Defensive searches ("how to compete with [company]")

**Outreach messaging:**
```
Subject: Re: [Competitor]'s growth in [market]

Hi [Name],

Saw [Competitor] announced [expansion/growth news].

I work with [industry] firms navigating competitive pressure—helping
them break through with intent-based GTM.

Recent client facing similar dynamics saw [outcome] in [timeframe].

Worth exploring?

[Scott]
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Don't explicitly bash competitor. Position as "you can compete differently."

---

### In Discovery

**Questions to surface competitive comparison:**

**1. Market awareness**
> "How are your competitors doing? Any of them growing faster than you?"

**Listen for:**
- Names specific competitors
- Frustration, envy, awareness of their success
- "They're winning deals we used to win"

**2. Lost deals**
> "When you lose a deal, who typically wins it? Is there a pattern?"

**Listen for:**
- Specific competitor names (who's winning)
- "They're more aggressive on outbound"
- "They have better positioning"

**3. Competitive positioning**
> "What do your competitors do differently? Why are they growing?"

**Listen for:**
- Awareness of competitor tactics
- Recognition that their approach is working
- Desire to match or beat them

**4. Internal pressure**
> "Do [leadership/board/investors] compare you to competitors? Is there pressure to keep up?"

**Listen for:**
- Board/investor pressure to match competitor growth
- Internal discussions about competitive position
- Fear of falling behind

**5. Strategic risk**
> "What happens if [competitor] continues growing while you plateau? How does that affect you?"

**Listen for:**
- Market share concerns
- Talent retention issues
- Customer perception problems
- Urgency level

---

### In Positioning

**How to use competitive comparison (without bashing):**

**1. Validate their observation**
> "You're right - [Competitor] is growing. They're doing something that's working. The question is: How do you compete differently?"

**2. Position alternative approach**
> "What most firms do: Try to copy competitors (rarely works - they're already established).
>
> What smart firms do: Find a different competitive angle.
>
> For you, that might be: [intent-based GTM / vertical specialization / niche positioning]."

**3. Show how others caught up**
> "I worked with a [industry] firm in similar position. [Competitor] was growing 30%/year, they were flat.
>
> We didn't try to copy [Competitor]. We found their weak spot: [X].
>
> Result: [Outcome]."

**4. Create urgency**
> "The risk of waiting: [Competitor] keeps growing, gets harder to compete, market share gap widens.
>
> The benefit of acting now: Close the gap while it's still catchable."

## Qualification Framework

### Strong Buying Signal If:

✅ **Specific competitor identified** (not vague "the market")
- Names company, aware of their tactics

✅ **Recent competitive losses** (last 6-12 months)
- Lost deals to them, losing market share

✅ **Visible competitor growth** (public announcements, funding, expansion)
- Easy to see they're winning

✅ **Internal pressure** (board/investors comparing)
- Stakeholder accountability to catch up

✅ **Strategic risk** (talent, customers, perception)
- Urgency beyond just revenue

---

### Weak Buying Signal If:

❌ **Vague awareness** ("competitors are doing fine")
- No specific competitor, no urgency

❌ **No recent losses** (not losing to them directly)
- Theoretical concern, not real pain

❌ **No internal pressure** (leadership doesn't track competitors)
- Lack of urgency

❌ **Market leader** (already winning, no threat)
- No competitive pressure = no trigger

---

## Pattern Status

**Validation Count:** 1 client (IVS Tax Services - implied competitive comparison)

**Status:** Hypothesis (need 2 more to validate)

**Next Validations:**
- [ ] Client 2: Do they also mention competitor growth as trigger?
- [ ] Client 3: Is competitive comparison a recurring theme?
- [ ] If YES to both → Promote to **Pattern: "Competitor growth = buying trigger"**

**Potential Generalization:**
- Not just B2B services (could be SaaS, ecommerce, any competitive market)
- Not just growth (could be innovation, talent, brand, market share)
- **Broader pattern:** "Watching competitors win creates urgency to act"

---

## When to Reference This Trigger

### In Prospecting
- **Target:** Companies in markets with visible competitive growth
- **Timing:** Right after competitor announces growth/expansion/funding
- **Messaging:** "How to compete with [growing competitor]" positioning

### In Content/Marketing
- **LinkedIn post:** "Your competitor is growing faster. Here's why (and what to do about it)."
- **Email subject line:** "Re: [Competitor]'s recent growth announcement"
- **Case study:** "How [Client] closed the gap with [Competitor] using [approach]"

### In Sales Enablement
- **Qualification:** Competitive pressure = urgency + budget (must compete or die)
- **Positioning:** "We help you compete differently (not copy)"
- **Urgency creation:** "Gap widens every month - act now to close it"

---

## Competitive Positioning Playbook

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't bash competitors**
- "Your competitor is terrible" (unprofessional)
- "They'll fail eventually" (wishful thinking)

❌ **Don't suggest copying them**
- "You should do what they're doing" (you'll always be behind)

❌ **Don't ignore the reality**
- "They're not really growing" (denial)

---

### What TO Do

✅ **Validate their success**
> "You're right - [Competitor] is growing. They've found something that works."

✅ **Position differentiation**
> "The question isn't 'How do we copy them?' It's 'How do we compete differently?'"

✅ **Find their weakness**
> "Every growing competitor has a blind spot. Let's find theirs and exploit it."

✅ **Show path to catch up**
> "Here's how others in your position closed the gap: [strategy]"

✅ **Create urgency**
> "The gap widens every month. Acting now vs. 6 months from now makes a difference."
