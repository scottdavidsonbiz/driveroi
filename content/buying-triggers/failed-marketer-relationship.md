# Buying Trigger: Failed Marketer/Agency Relationship

## The Trigger
Company recently ended or is frustrated with current marketer/agency—creating openness to replacement vendor.

---

## How to Identify It

### IVS Tax Services Example

**Signals Observed:**
- "Current marketer makes excuses, doesn't deliver results" (direct quote from Jeffrey)
- "Spray-and-pray approach not working"
- Micromanaging: Must review all outbound before it goes out (lack of trust)
- Quality concerns: "She uses AI, can't write" (shown 4x-too-long email example)
- Frustration building: Looking for alternatives (hence conversation with Scott)

**Discovery Questions That Revealed It:**
1. **"Who's handling marketing/outbound for you right now?"**
   - Answer: "We have a marketer but..."

2. **"How's that relationship going? Getting the results you need?"**
   - Answer: "She makes excuses... spray-and-pray approach... not working"

3. **"Do you find yourself having to review or fix their work?"**
   - Answer: "We have to review everything before it goes out" (micromanagement signal)

---

## Why This Creates Urgency

### Fresh Pain
- **Active frustration:** Not historical ("we had a bad agency 2 years ago")
- **Current suffering:** Happening right now, compounding weekly
- **Emotional intensity:** Fresh wounds = stronger motivation to change

### Wasted Investment
- **Paying for nothing:** Spending money on marketer with no ROI
- **Opportunity cost:** Budget tied up in failed relationship
- **Sunk cost:** Already wasted months/years, don't want to waste more

### Micromanagement Burden
- **Time sink:** Jeffrey/Jennifer reviewing every email (bottleneck)
- **Leadership distraction:** Should focus on strategy, stuck in tactics
- **Defeats purpose:** Hired marketer to offload work, instead created more work

### Trust Broken
- **Can't rely on them:** Must review everything (no autonomy)
- **Professional risk:** IVS has ethical standards, marketer could violate them
- **Cognitive dissonance:** "Why are we paying someone we have to manage?"

---

## Buying Trigger Formula

```
Failed vendor relationship (current/recent)
+ Micromanagement burden (trust broken)
+ No results despite investment (wasted money)
+ Fresh frustration (emotional intensity)
= High urgency to switch vendors
```

---

## How to Leverage This Trigger

### In Discovery

**1. Surface the Pain**
- **Question:** "Who's handling [marketing/outbound/GTM] for you right now?"
- **Listen for:** "We have someone but..." (red flag: dissatisfaction)

**2. Quantify the Problem**
- **Question:** "How's that relationship going? Getting the results you need?"
- **Listen for:** Excuses, lack of results, frustration, blame

**3. Reveal Micromanagement**
- **Question:** "Do you find yourself having to review or fix their work?"
- **Listen for:** "We review everything" (trust broken)

**4. Understand Investment**
- **Question:** "How long have you been working with them? What are you paying?"
- **Listen for:** Duration (sunk cost), cost (budget exists)

**5. Create Urgency**
- **Question:** "What happens if this continues for another 6 months?"
- **Listen for:** Opportunity cost, lost revenue, competitive disadvantage

---

### In Positioning

**Differentiate from Failed Vendor:**

| What Failed Vendor Did | What Scott Does Differently |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Spray-and-pray (volume-based) | Intent-based (targeted, personalized) |
| Generic, AI-written content | Short, personalized, human-reviewed |
| Black box (no visibility) | Bi-weekly calls, weekly reports (transparency) |
| Makes excuses, no accountability | Data-driven iteration, benchmarked performance |
| Vendor lock-in (owns tools) | Client owns infrastructure (no lock-in) |
| Requires micromanagement | Approve frameworks upfront, then autonomous |

**Key Message:** "We're the opposite of what didn't work for you"

---

### In Proposal

**1. Acknowledge the Pain**
> "I know you've had a frustrating experience with your current marketer. Here's what we do differently..."

**2. Position as Replacement (Not Addition)**
- Not: "Use us alongside your marketer"
- Yes: "We'll replace your current marketer with a better approach"

**3. De-Risk the Transition**
- **Safety net:** "3-month test. If we're not better than your current marketer, you can exit"
- **Ownership:** "You own all tools/accounts - not locked into another vendor"
- **Transparency:** "Bi-weekly reviews - you'll see exactly what's happening"

**4. Show Quality Standards**
- **Email example:** Short, personalized, professional (vs. 4x-too-long AI content)
- **Benchmarks:** LinkedIn 20-30% reply rates (data-driven, not excuses)
- **Systematic:** ICP scoring, A/B testing, intent signals (vs. spray-and-pray)

---

## Qualification Criteria

### Strong Buying Signal If:

✅ **Active frustration** (current vendor, not past)
- "We're frustrated with our current agency"
- "They make excuses instead of delivering results"

✅ **Micromanagement required** (trust broken)
- "We have to review everything before it goes out"
- "I find myself fixing their work"

✅ **No results despite investment** (wasted money)
- "We've been working with them for [months/years]"
- "Not seeing the ROI we expected"

✅ **Budget exists** (already paying someone)
- "We're spending $X/month on [vendor]"
- "We've invested in [tool/agency]"

✅ **Considering change** (openness to switch)
- "We're looking for alternatives"
- "Open to trying a different approach"

---

### Weak Buying Signal If:

❌ **Historical frustration** (not current)
- "We had a bad agency 2 years ago" (past pain, not fresh)

❌ **Not actively looking** (passive)
- "Our current agency is fine, just exploring options" (no urgency)

❌ **Unrealistic expectations** (serial churners)
- "We've been through 5 agencies in 2 years" (red flag: might be them, not vendors)

❌ **No budget** (DIY only)
- "We can't afford an agency" (no current investment)

## Competitive Positioning Playbook

- "That's why we structure it with [safety net / ownership model / transparency]"
- "You'll see results in [timeframe] or you can exit"

**4. Give Control**
- "You approve messaging frameworks upfront"
- "You own all tools/accounts (no lock-in)"
- "Bi-weekly reviews - you have full visibility"

- **Case study angle:** "How we replaced a spray-and-pray agency with data-driven GTM"

### In Sales Enablement
- **Qualification:** Failed vendor = budget exists + urgency + openness
- **Positioning:** Lead with differentiation (how you're different from failed vendor)
- **Closing:** Use fresh pain as urgency ("how long will you continue with subpar results?")
