# Buying Trigger: Stagnant Sales Growth

## The Trigger
Company experiencing sales stagnation despite historical success—creating urgency to try new GTM approaches.

---

## How to Identify It

### IVS Tax Services Example

**Signals:**
- **26 years in business** (established, historically successful)
- **Post-COVID plateau:** "We've been stagnant" (direct quote)
- **Competitor comparison:** Seeing competitors grow while they don't
- **Failed attempts:** Tried marketer, invested in ZoomInfo ($10K+/year), no improvement
- **Urgency:** Tax season approaching, need momentum

**Discovery Questions That Revealed It:**
1. **"How's growth been over the last 2-3 years?"**
   - Answer: "Post-COVID, we've been stagnant"

2. **"Are you seeing competitors grow while you plateau?"**
   - Answer: Yes (implied by frustration)

3. **"What have you tried so far to address this?"**
   - Answer: Hired marketer (failing), invested in ZoomInfo (low ROI)

4. **"What happens if this continues for another year?"**
   - Answer: Competitive disadvantage, lost market share, revenue target missed

---

## Why This Creates Urgency

### Identity Threat
- **"We're a 26-year firm"** = Source of pride
- **"We've been stagnant"** = Threat to identity
- **Cognitive dissonance:** Should be growing (given track record) but aren't

### Competitive Pressure
- **Watching competitors win** amplifies frustration
- **Market share loss:** Others growing = IVS losing relative position
- **Fear of irrelevance:** "Are we being left behind?"

### Failed Attempts = Lowered Resistance
- **Already tried solutions:** Marketer, ZoomInfo (wasted money)
- **Sunk cost:** Don't want to waste more time/money doing nothing
- **Openness:** "What we're doing isn't working" = willing to try new approach

### Stakeholder Pressure
- **Partners need to show momentum:** Jeffrey, Jennifer, James all see the plateau
- **Accountability:** Leadership must address stagnation (can't ignore it)
- **Urgency to act:** Seasonal deadline (tax season) compounds urgency

---

## Buying Trigger Formula

```
Stagnation (recent, visible)
+ Failed attempts (tried solutions, didn't work)
+ Competitor growth (watching others win)
+ Seasonal urgency (time pressure)
= High urgency to buy
```

## How to Leverage This Trigger

### In Prospecting

**Identify stagnant companies:**
- **LinkedIn signals:**
  - No growth announcements in 12+ months
  - Hiring freeze (no recent job postings)
  - Layoffs or restructuring mentioned
- **Intent signals:**
  - Searching for "growth strategies," "sales consultant," "marketing agency"
  - Job changes (new CMO, new VP Sales = mandate to fix growth)
- **Public data:**
  - Flat revenue (if publicly disclosed)
  - No new product launches / expansion announcements

**Outreach messaging:**
```
Subject: Re: Breaking through post-COVID stagnation

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] has been around [X] years (congrats on longevity).

I work with established [industry] firms experiencing post-COVID plateaus—
helping them break through with intent-based GTM (vs. spray-and-pray).

Recent client (26-year property tax firm) saw [outcome] in [timeframe].

Worth a conversation?

[Scott]
```

### In Discovery

**Questions to surface this trigger:**

**1. Growth trajectory**
> "How's growth been over the last 2-3 years? Where are you relative to goals?"

**Listen for:**
- "Flat," "stagnant," "plateau," "not where we want to be"
- Comparison to past success: "We used to grow X% annually, now..."

**2. Competitive comparison**
> "How are your competitors doing? Are they growing while you're flat?"

**Listen for:**
- Frustration, envy, competitive pressure
- "They're winning deals we used to win"

**3. Failed attempts**
> "What have you tried so far to address this? What didn't work?"

**Listen for:**
- Agencies fired, tools abandoned, initiatives failed
- Sunk cost, wasted investment, skepticism

**4. Consequences**
> "What happens if this continues for another 6-12 months?"

**Listen for:**
- Market share loss, revenue targets missed, competitive irrelevance
- Urgency level (how bad would it be?)

**5. Internal pressure**
> "How do [leadership/partners/board] feel about this? Is there pressure to show momentum?"

**Listen for:**
- Stakeholder accountability, mandate to fix, timeline pressure

### In Positioning

**How Scott leveraged IVS stagnation:**

**Discovery Call (10/29):**
1. **Named the pain:** "You mentioned stagnation post-COVID"
2. **Created contrast:** "Spray-and-pray (current marketer) vs. intent-based (what we do)"
3. **Positioned differentiation:** Modern GTM = fix for stagnation

**Proposal Presentation (11/3):**
1. **Used data:** "LinkedIn 20-30% reply rates" (better results than current approach)
2. **Tied to outcomes:** "You need $400K new business. One deal = 3.6x ROI on this investment"
3. **Created urgency:** "Tax season closing - every week of delay = lost opportunity"

**Kickoff Meeting (11/11):**
1. **Systematic approach:** ICP definition, intent signals, A/B testing (vs. spray-and-pray)
2. **Fast timeline:** "Show momentum before year-end"

## Qualification Framework

### Strong Buying Signal If:

✅ **Recent stagnation** (last 12-24 months, not 5 years ago)
- Fresh pain = higher urgency

✅ **Tried to fix it** (failed attempts, wasted investment)
- Lowers resistance to change, increases openness

✅ **Competitor comparison** (watching others grow)
- Amplifies frustration, creates urgency

✅ **Budget exists** (already spending on solutions)
- IVS: $10K+/year on ZoomInfo, paying marketer

✅ **Decision-maker access** (champion or direct authority)
- IVS: Jeffrey = partner, can influence decision

✅ **Timeline pressure** (seasonal, budget, competitive)
- IVS: Tax season urgency = compressed timeline

---

### Weak Buying Signal If:

❌ **Historical stagnation** (been flat for 5+ years)
- Accepted reality, no urgency

❌ **Haven't tried anything** (no failed attempts)
- May not see it as problem yet

❌ **No competitive pressure** (don't track competitors)
- Lacks urgency amplifier

❌ **No budget** (not spending on growth initiatives)
- May not be prioritized

❌ **No access** (talking to junior person, no champion)
- Can't drive decision

## Pattern Status

**Validation Count:** 1 client (IVS Tax Services - 26-year firm, stagnant post-COVID)

**Status:** Hypothesis (need 2 more to validate)

**Next Validations:**
- [ ] Client 2: Do they also have stagnant growth as buying trigger?
- [ ] Client 3: Is this a recurring trigger across clients?
- [ ] If YES to both → Promote to **Pattern: "Stagnant growth = strong buying trigger"**

**Potential Generalization:**
- Not just post-COVID (could be any market shift, competitive change, internal issue)
- Not just 26-year firms (could be 3-year firm hitting plateau after rapid growth)
- **Broader pattern:** "Recent stagnation (visible, frustrating, threatening) creates urgency to act"

---

## When to Reference This Trigger

### In Prospecting
- **Target:** Companies with flat growth announcements, no hiring, restructuring
- **Messaging:** "Breaking through stagnation" positioning
- **Timing:** Look for 12-18 months post-plateau (fresh pain, not accepted)

### In Content/Marketing
- **LinkedIn post:** "Why established B2B firms plateau post-COVID (and what to do about it)"
- **Email subject line:** "Re: Stagnant growth despite strong track record"
- **Webinar topic:** "Breaking Through Post-COVID Stagnation: 3 GTM Strategies That Work"

### In Sales Enablement
- **Qualification:** Stagnation + failed attempts + urgency = hot lead
- **Positioning:** "We help established firms break through plateaus"
- **Case studies:** Lead with stagnation → breakthrough transformation
