# Support Tech LLC - Discovery Call Prep

## Quick Context
- **Company:** Support Tech LLC (supporttech.com)
- **Services:** Field services, IT relocation, IT staffing (nationwide, 45+ years)
- **Target customers:** Multi-location businesses (hospitality, healthcare, education, retail)
- **Your deliverable:** 25-lead list already sent

---

## Discovery Framework (30-45 min call)

### 1. Current State (5-10 min)

**"How are you generating leads today?"**
- Listen for: Referrals, inbound, trade shows, cold calling, channel partners
- Red flag: 100% referrals = no system, unpredictable pipeline
- Green flag: Some outbound already = they get it, just need to scale

**"What's working? What's not?"**
- Listen for: Volume issues, quality issues, conversion issues
- Goal: Identify the gap you'll fill

**"How many qualified meetings are you getting per month right now?"**
- Benchmark current state
- Sets baseline for success metrics

---

### 2. Target Customer & Pain Points (10 min)

**"Walk me through your ideal customer."**
- Listen for: Company size, # of locations, industries, geography
- Validate against your 25-lead list
- Note: If they say "everyone with multiple locations," help them narrow it

**"What triggers someone to need you right now?"**
- Listen for: New location openings, relocations, M&A, tech failures, staffing gaps
- These become your prospecting signals

**"Who's the decision maker? What's the buying process look like?"**
- Listen for: Titles (CIO, VP IT, Facilities), buying committee, sales cycle length
- Note: Longer cycle = need more top-of-funnel volume

---

### 3. Goals & Metrics (5 min)

**"What does success look like for you in the next 6 months?"**
- Listen for: Pipeline targets, revenue goals, # of new customers
- Convert to meetings needed: "So if you need $2M in new revenue and average deal is $50K, that's 40 deals, which means ~120 qualified meetings at 33% close rate. Does that math track?"

**"What's holding you back from hitting that goal?"**
- Listen for: Not enough leads, wrong leads, too busy, no system
- This is where you position yourself

---

### 4. Budget & Timeline (5 min)

**"Have you worked with an outbound partner before? What happened?"**
- Listen for: Bad experiences, expectations, budget range
- Note: If they had bad experience, ask what went wrong

**"What's your budget for lead gen / sales development?"**
- If they hedge: "Most companies your size invest $5K-$10K/month for a dedicated outbound motion. Does that ballpark make sense?"
- Goal: Qualify if they can afford you ($5-6K/month target)

**"When do you want to start seeing results?"**
- Listen for: Urgency (Q1 goals, board pressure, etc.)
- Note: If "no rush," they're probably not serious

---

### 5. Decision Process (5 min)

**"If this makes sense, what's the process to move forward?"**
- Listen for: Solo decision, need partner buy-in, legal review, etc.
- Red flag: "I need to talk to 5 people first" = long sales cycle

**"What would make this a no-brainer yes for you?"**
- Listen for: ROI expectations, risk tolerance, proof needed
- This tells you how to close them

## Your Positioning (How to Present What You Do)

**If they ask "What do you do?":**

*"We build always-on outbound systems for B2B service companies like Support Tech. Here's what that means:*

*1. We define your ICP and build a database of 5,000-10,000 target accounts*
*2. We write multi-touch email and LinkedIn sequences*
*3. We launch campaigns targeting 500-1,000 prospects per month*
*4. We book qualified meetings directly on your calendar*

*Most clients see 10-20 qualified meetings per month within 90 days. Our retainer is $5,500/month, and we work month-to-month after the first 3 months.*

*Based on the 25-account list I sent—those are the types of companies we'd target at scale. Make sense?"*

---

## Questions to Answer for Them

**"What makes you different from other agencies?"**
- *"Two things: (1) We focus on data and systems, not just spray-and-pray. Brenda has RevOps background from PE portfolio companies, I have FP&A background from 6sense—we track CAC, conversion rates, ROI. (2) We build it, run it, prove it works, then you can bring it in-house or keep us. We're not trying to lock you into 12-month contracts."*

**"How long until we see results?"**
- *"Month 1 is setup (ICP, lists, copy, CRM). Month 2 we start sending emails (expect 20-40 replies). Month 3 we optimize and scale (goal is 10-15 qualified meetings). By Month 4-6, you should be at 15-25 meetings/month if the ICP and messaging are dialed in."*

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
- *"We work month-to-month after Month 3. If you're not seeing ROI, you can cancel. That said, outbound takes 60-90 days to ramp—we're not going to book 20 meetings in Week 2. But we track everything: emails sent, open rates, reply rates, meetings booked. You'll see the funnel working before deals close."*

## Close the Call

**If qualified:**
*"This sounds like a good fit. Here's what I'd propose:*

*Month 1: Build your ICP, database, messaging, and CRM setup ($5,500)*
*Months 2-3: Launch campaigns, optimize based on data ($5,500/month)*
*Goal: 10-20 qualified meetings/month by Month 3*

*Does that timeline and investment make sense for you? If so, I'll send over a simple 2-page agreement and we can kick off next week."*

**If not qualified but good relationship:**
*"Appreciate the conversation. Sounds like you're not quite ready for a full outbound motion yet. I'll stay in touch—let me know if anything changes or if you want to revisit in a few months."*
