## Suggested Process

1. **Share this doc** with your partner in advance
2. **Each fill out your column** independently before meeting
3. **Meet for 90 min** to compare answers and discuss gaps
4. **Document decisions** in a shared doc
5. **Bring that doc to your lawyer** — saves hours of billable time

4. **Advisory Board Vote** — 1-3 trusted advisors vote on deadlock
5. **Shotgun Clause** — Partner A names a price; Partner B must buy or sell at that price
