## LinkedIn Connection Request

Keep blank or ultra-short. Long notes kill accept rates.

**Option A: No note** (highest accept rate)

**Option B: Short note**
```
Hey [First Name] — came across [Company] while researching [industry]. Would love to connect.
```

---

## LinkedIn DM #1: Opening (Day 6)

Send after they accept connection, wait ~1 day.

### Default Version (Hiring Signal)
```
Hey [First Name] — noticed [Company] is hiring sales roles. Curious how you're thinking about the infrastructure side as you scale — prospecting systems, data, etc.

Or is the plan to just add headcount and figure it out?
```

### Alternate: No Marketing Automation Detected
```
Hey [First Name] — quick question. How is [Company] handling outbound prospecting right now? Manually, or do you have systems in place?

Asking because most [industry] companies I talk to are still doing it the hard way.
```

### Alternate: Recent Leadership Change
```
Hey [First Name] — saw you recently joined [Company]. Congrats.

Curious what's on your radar for sales ops as you get settled — or is it too early to think about infrastructure?
```

### Alternate: Headcount Growing
```
Hey [First Name] — [Company] looks like it's on a tear. Adding people fast.

Quick question: is the sales process scaling with the team, or is it still pretty manual?
```

---

## LinkedIn DM #2: Follow-up (Day 15)

If no response to DM #1:

```
Hey [First Name] — circling back.

I work with [industry] companies building the sales infrastructure that tech companies have — automated prospecting, clean CRM, real pipeline visibility.

Usually takes 60 days to set up. Runs in the background after that.

Worth a quick call to see if it fits what you're building?
```

---

## LinkedIn DM #3: Soft Close (Day 21)

Optional final touch after email breakup:

```
Last one from me — if sales infrastructure ever becomes a priority at [Company], happy to share what we've built for other [industry] companies.

Either way, good luck scaling the team.
```

---

## Email Sequences

### Email 1: Problem-Focused Intro (Day 5)

**Subject line options (A/B test):**
- Quick question about [Company]'s sales process
- [Company] + a pattern I'm seeing in [their industry]
- Manual prospecting at [Company]?

```
Hi [First Name],

I've been researching [their industry] companies and noticed something interesting.

The ones growing fastest aren't hiring more salespeople. They're building systems that automate manual work. Prospecting, research, and follow-up are all running while their team focuses on selling.

Meanwhile, most [their industry] companies are still doing it the old way. Manual prospecting, messy CRMs, no visibility into what's actually driving pipeline.

I work with companies like [Company] to build those systems — the same infrastructure tech companies have, without requiring you to become one.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if this is relevant?

—Brenda
```

### Email 2: Insight/Value-Add (Day 8)

**Subject:** Re: [previous subject]

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up — wanted to share something specific.

I was looking at job postings in [their industry] and noticed a pattern: companies are hiring salespeople but not investing in systems to make them effective.

It's like hiring more people to dig with shovels instead of buying an excavator.

Here's what "the excavator" looks like for sales:

→ Automated research on every prospect (before your team touches them)
→ Personalized outreach at scale (not one email at a time)
→ CRM that stays clean without manual work
→ Dashboards showing exactly what's driving pipeline

Takes about 60 days to build. Works while your team sleeps.

Is this something you've thought about, or is manual working fine for now?

—Brenda
```

---

### Email 3: Different Angle - Analytics (Day 14)

**Subject:** The visibility problem at [Company]

```
Hi [First Name],

Trying one more angle because I think this might resonate.

When I talk to [their industry] leaders, the #1 complaint isn't "we need more leads." It's:

"We can't see what's actually working."

→ Which campaigns are driving pipeline?
→ Where do deals stall?
→ What should we do more of?

Most companies are flying blind, relying on gut feel instead of data.

That's actually what makes us different. Every system we build comes with analytics baked in. You don't just get automation. You get visibility into whether it's working.

If pipeline visibility is a priority for you, let's talk.

—Brenda
```

---

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 20)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about bringing modern sales infrastructure to [Company].

Haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:

1. Not a priority right now (totally fair)
2. You've got this handled already (great)
3. My emails went to spam (less great)

Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox.

If this becomes relevant down the road, I'm easy to find. We help [their industry] companies build the systems that tech companies have — automated prospecting, clean data, real-time analytics.

Best of luck with everything at [Company].

—Brenda
```

## Tone Differences: Email vs LinkedIn

| Aspect | Email | LinkedIn DM |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Length | 100-200 words | Under 50 words |
| Greeting | "Hi [First Name]," | "Hey [First Name] —" |
| Structure | Paragraphs, bullet points | 2-3 short sentences |
| Value prop | Full explanation | One hook or question |
| CTA | "Worth a 15-minute call?" | "Curious how you're thinking about X?" |
| Tone | Professional, structured | Casual, conversational |

## LinkedIn Best Practices

**Warm-First Approach:**
1. View their profile (Day 1)
2. Follow them
3. Like/comment on a post (if active)
4. Send connection request (Day 2)
5. Wait for accept, then DM

**Volume Limits:**
- Stay under 50 connection requests/day
- Stagger activity throughout the day
- Don't blast all at once

**Timing:**
- Best days: Tuesday - Thursday
- Best times: 8-10 AM or 5-6 PM (their timezone)
- Avoid weekends

**Voice Notes:**
Consider sending DM #2 as a voice note instead of text — they stand out and feel more personal.

---

## Response Handling

**If they respond positively:**
- Move to calendar booking immediately
- Don't over-explain in DMs — save it for the call

**If they respond "not now":**
- Acknowledge, thank them, ask when to follow up
- Add to nurture sequence (quarterly check-in)

**If they respond negatively:**
- Thank them, remove from sequence
- Don't argue or push back

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| LinkedIn connection accept rate | 30-40% |
| LinkedIn DM reply rate | 10-20% |
| Email open rate | 40-60% |
| Email reply rate | 3-8% |
| Meeting book rate (total) | 2-5% of contacted |
