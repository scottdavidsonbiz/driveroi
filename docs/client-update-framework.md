## Best Practices

### Before the Meeting
- Send update doc 24 hours in advance
- Include any links/docs they need to review
- Flag items that need their input clearly

### During the Meeting
- Share screen for demos - don't just describe
- Take notes on feedback in real-time
- Confirm action items before ending

### After the Meeting
- Send summary with action items within 24 hours
- Update project tracker/todo list
- Create calendar holds for any follow-ups

## Meeting Cadence by Engagement Phase

| Phase | Cadence | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Month 1 (Setup)** | Weekly | Alignment, ICP, infrastructure |
| **Months 2-3 (Launch)** | Bi-weekly | Execution, feedback loops, optimization |
| **Month 4+ (Scale)** | Bi-weekly or Monthly | Metrics, strategy, expansion |

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

- Client stops responding to async updates
- Feedback loops taking longer than 1 week
- Scope creep without pricing discussion
- Meetings getting rescheduled repeatedly

**If you see these:** Address directly in next meeting or async message.
