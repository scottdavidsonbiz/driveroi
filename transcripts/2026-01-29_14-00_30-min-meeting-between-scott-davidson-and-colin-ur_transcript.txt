[19:00:39 - 19:00:56] Colin Uren: Yeah. Yeah. I'm practicing, it's take it a little while doing lots of tutoring. just, it's kind of a blessing and a curse that there's a lot of Westerners and in my building, But it's a work in progress, for sure. I know French

[19:00:56 - 19:00:57] Scott Davidson: Oh, okay.

[19:00:58 - 19:01:03] Colin Uren: From being in Canada. But it's yeah, it's it's definitely working progress. Yeah.

[19:01:03 - 19:01:07] Scott Davidson: That's cool. And you just join the boot camp recently, right?

[19:01:04 - 19:01:19] Colin Uren: Yeah. Yeah, I just bought my clay account today. Matter of fact, and I yeah, just digging into the clay course now. So yeah. How about yourself?

[19:01:22 - 19:01:33] Scott Davidson: Nice. I'm through the technical. I'm effectively graduated. I just finished the technical part last week. and I have a couple like mentor sessions left, but I think I joined in like,

[19:01:29 - 19:01:29] Colin Uren: Nice.

[19:01:33 - 19:01:35] Scott Davidson: November, maybe something like that.

[19:01:35 - 19:01:39] Colin Uren: November. Okay, awesome. I was, I was

[19:01:37 - 19:01:38] Scott Davidson: Yeah. So

[19:01:41 - 19:01:45] Colin Uren: As a, How's it going so far? And are you, are you open up your own agency or you looking for?

[19:01:45 - 19:01:46] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:01:45 - 19:01:46] Colin Uren: to work with one or

[19:01:48 - 19:02:02] Scott Davidson: No, that's the goal. The goal is on. To. Well we've started that I started the agency, we have an LLC and everything, my backgrounds and finance and then in software and my partner, we're gonna kind

[19:01:57 - 19:01:57] Colin Uren: Nice.

[19:02:11 - 19:02:39] Scott Davidson: operations, also in software. So, we're just like meeting of the minds. I'm the last couple months. Just like on a trial run, her backgrounds in revenue of spin up a partnership pretty soon here, but we've been working together for probably gonna handle the Clay. Outbound slash like CRM enrichment and then show handle like the actual CRM the pipeline staging, some of the forecasting. And then also we both do. We both reported like the office of the CFO. So we would do like board reporting and

[19:02:38 - 19:02:45] Colin Uren: Cool.

[19:02:44 - 19:02:56] Scott Davidson: It's fundraising help with stuff like that, so slightly different angle than some of the other folks in the boot camp. But And you're in the Oil and gas or industrial, right?

[19:02:57 - 19:03:06] Colin Uren: Well it's it's kind of interesting, I I got it to like B2B Tech sales would have been 20.

[19:03:10 - 19:03:10] Scott Davidson: 

[19:03:10 - 19:03:15] Colin Uren: This is 2022. I took a basically, the same thing, three month boot camp to learn how to cold call and an email. And then

[19:03:13 - 19:03:13] Scott Davidson: Nice.

[19:03:18 - 19:04:06] Colin Uren: I was in a good really good company as a SDR with a company to Toronto, and then I started working for my father. He's got a small Software startup. There's three of us. So it's me him and our engineer. So it's servicing a large, capital projects, helping them with project, controls And we have our own internal software but we're focusing on the service of it. project execution. and I mean there's lots of up and downs with that, but that's the main reason why I joined the boot camp was to build out to go to market strategy for that because we're we're basically I mean there is there is no strategy. It's it's you know just fly by the skin of our teeth kind of thing and you know what it is? Yeah, just all manual. So

[19:04:02 - 19:04:02] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:04:06 - 19:04:23] Colin Uren:  The the oil and gas comes into it. We're We haven't worked with a specific oil and gas company yet but where we have a commissioning. Consultant group, that deals with commissioning and oil and gas. And so,

[19:04:24 - 19:04:24] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:04:27 - 19:04:38] Colin Uren: But that's kind of who I'm going to figure out my Tam for is like construction of things in oil and gas. Real estate and infrastructure really.

[19:04:42 - 19:04:58] Scott Davidson: Okay, yeah. So that's what I thought. It might be good to connect on. That is we did. We got our first client, which is a industrial valuation. Company. So they help. dispute assessments basically, for Oil and gas manufacturing.

[19:04:57 - 19:04:57] Colin Uren: Yes.

[19:05:00 - 19:05:20] Scott Davidson: Chemical polymers. And Warehousing. Any industrial property? That's like their specialty. So, we just sign them up. We're probably like a month. Yeah, we're about a five weeks in. So we set up their infrastructure.

[19:05:18 - 19:05:19] Colin Uren: Nice nice.

[19:05:25 - 19:05:30] Scott Davidson: work in accounting and tax so I'm like a little you know semi-familiar with like we're kind of early days of like I used to work in because finance I used to

[19:05:28 - 19:05:28] Colin Uren: Good.

[19:05:32 - 19:05:51] Scott Davidson: The entirety of the thing. But I don't know the industry like Super Duper well. so, I've been don't have a CRM, They just been tracking for 26 years in a Google Sheet or Just trying to target, you know, same thing like figure. And then they, they spreadsheet.

[19:05:52 - 19:05:53] Colin Uren: While yes.

[19:05:55 - 19:05:59] Scott Davidson: so I've had to go through and like segment there Mark who their current customers are into

[19:05:58 - 19:05:58] Colin Uren: Wow.

[19:06:01 - 19:06:06] Scott Davidson: Environmental services and chemical manufacturing and oily eyes and blah. So oh and mining. They do mining.

[19:06:07 - 19:06:07] Colin Uren: Yes. Yeah.

[19:06:08 - 19:06:37] Scott Davidson: so, Just trying to sort through that and then target and it's It's been, Yeah, interesting. I mean, definitely early days and still, like learning. But trying to figure out like, how to target the, you know, it's like complex operations with Many sites. And I'm sure the buying, uh, processes. Intense and long and all that stuff, right?

[19:06:35 - 19:07:19] Colin Uren: Yeah. Yeah. It is long. Yeah. and we have, I mean, we have many offer. We have our own software and I finally Issues at the startup, not just go to market. It's trying to figure out our own I was able to communicate with my father, like we cannot sell the software we have to sell the service first just because It's just not built out to. doing projects on Windows like, Microsoft Project or Primavera, P6. And like Like there's just so much things missing. Like it's the whole industry is is we're a Mac Mac only product where like Mac iOS and Mac OS Native. So,

[19:07:17 - 19:07:17] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:07:19 - 19:07:43] Colin Uren: it's It's been a learning curve, for sure. And we're always trying to figure out like, How do we, what is our offer? And I always say, like, we're like doing a schedule audit, we'll take your project schedule from Microsoft or P6 and we'll import it into our software and show you. you know, you're missing durations, you're missing dependencies,

[19:07:45 - 19:07:45] Scott Davidson: In.

[19:07:47 - 19:07:59] Colin Uren: Possibility, planning critical path and that sort of thing, but it's, it's a work in progress. So With your client are they? They law firm like dealing like they come in and do the disputes or

[19:08:01 - 19:08:15] Scott Davidson: They're not a law firm, they're They're not assessors either, but they They're I don't know what they call themselves, like valuation experts, but let me let me see what they call themselves.

[19:08:15 - 19:08:17] Colin Uren: Sure. Yeah, let me take a peek at

[19:08:16 - 19:08:29] Scott Davidson: They call themselves. Specialized. Property Tax consulting. For industrial and manufacturing facilities. The Fat, the original founder worked at

[19:08:30 - 19:08:35] Colin Uren: Exxon Mobil.

[19:08:31 - 19:08:36] Scott Davidson: Axon, I believe. For intex. Yeah.

[19:08:37 - 19:08:48] Colin Uren: So they do. Tap tax to that tax, for the capital projects industry, basically over across

[19:08:46 - 19:08:50] Scott Davidson: yeah, so like

[19:08:48 - 19:08:55] Colin Uren: mining and Yes.

[19:08:56 - 19:09:56] Scott Davidson: Okay, they do strategic tax planning, incentive procurement, rail, property analysis, personal property, compliance assessment, negotiation and appeal. And audit management. But at least the offer that we've talked about in our attempting to look at now is like The assessment negotiation. I guess because there's like cost reduction, so you know, they have examples of Oh we worked with functional obsolescence, or whatever that means and we saved them 100,000 or This chemical or down oil, drilling company and they didn't account for what something like that. so, They're targeting like it's very similar, 10 mil. Well, 10 million. Plus evaluation of properties. It could be one or multiple on, and they go like they go on site and Dig around and say, Okay, you have this that and the other and then, yeah, they work with like the

[19:09:56 - 19:10:04] Colin Uren: He?

[19:09:58 - 19:10:03] Scott Davidson: They're like, directly dispute it with the County or, you know, taxing entity.

[19:10:05 - 19:10:11] Colin Uren: Yeah, it's I'd say it's a little, it's different in a sense that I'm dealing with the actual

[19:10:14 - 19:10:14] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:10:17 - 19:10:22] Colin Uren: Instruction of it of the building like with like the project schedule, like the tasks and all that sort of thing. But I can see why, you know, it

[19:10:19 - 19:10:19] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:10:23 - 19:10:42] Colin Uren: you know, kind of like overlaps with I mean, I wouldn't even like, think of something like that, like with with a background is not in construction. My background is actually in hospitality and property, I'm not in construction, like, I don't have a bad, I, you know, I've done some constructional, small crews and stuff growing up, but like my whole then I got into tech and then

[19:10:41 - 19:10:41] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:10:43 - 19:11:04] Colin Uren: Then with the startup now overview and just and just targeting that. But Yeah, I mean, are you? I don't know if I can help you in any way. Maybe just kind of talk it out, kind of thing. And are you looking for something in specific or you just kind of saw me? Type in that ICP.

[19:11:05 - 19:11:10] Scott Davidson: Yeah, just thought of you I catch up and say, Yeah, we're targeting similar

[19:11:05 - 19:11:05] Colin Uren: Yeah.

[19:11:08 - 19:11:10] Scott Davidson: things, I know. Yeah. It's definitely different. I mean, I don't know if

[19:11:08 - 19:11:09] Colin Uren: I see. Okay, yeah.

[19:11:15 - 19:11:41] Scott Davidson: Even your targeting just the US or yeah, or how you're finding the people. I just curious kind of share notes. And I mean, I have lists already that I've built. If it's helpful for you, I mean there are It's nothing novel. Like their companies, you've Well not, you probably heard of many of them. And then I'm just kind of like using Claude and different AI tools. Like, Okay, I need a list of like 200 oil field service companies that probably have 10 million dollars and valued assets.

[19:11:41 - 19:11:42] Colin Uren: I see, I see.

[19:11:42 - 19:11:49] Scott Davidson: In Texas, Oklahoma Louisiana and then like, Go do it. And then I'm finding

[19:11:47 - 19:11:54] Colin Uren: I see. Yes.

[19:12:03 - 19:12:10] Scott Davidson: The controller, the CFO, any like VP plus and just kind of like reaching out to them. That's been the process today. But I didn't know if like even just in terms of like how they procure, even if it's a different department, you know, like that sort of thing, if you like, notice any trends or anything like that.

[19:12:11 - 19:13:08] Colin Uren: Honestly, our outreach has been so manual, like there's just reaching out to individuals one by one. My father did not want to put it like any money into marketing. So, basically, everything is been organic inbound And like, that's why I joined, this course, like we're, we were literally, like, through, like, LinkedIn posts. So like, I don't even have Like LinkedIn Sales, Navigator or Apollo to scrape lists? We've just Started with like, okay. I need to actually like really like figure this out and, and Figure out. An A/b test like our icps with. I guess what you saw there in the text that that one day. And I'm definitely, I'm happy you brought this up because I would like to bounce off ideas with you back and forth because this is the same. It is like Oh,

[19:13:05 - 19:13:06] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:13:09 - 19:13:24] Colin Uren: You know. Infrastructure buildings, 10 million above. the people that you're looking for, are they like Are they construction companies? Or it's more of like property management.

[19:13:27 - 19:13:37] Scott Davidson: so the ones we've reached out to thus far are actually Well, there's a couple things. We're running a couple different campaigns right now. The first one is

[19:13:36 - 19:13:36] Colin Uren: Mm-hmm.

[19:13:38 - 19:14:14] Scott Davidson: just, Oil field service companies. In those three states. So they just like, maybe they rent the equipment out, or they do the drilling or whatever, or they have the polymers that help the gas come out better, you know, that sort of thing but they're actually but they give they send the oil to the refineries. Um, so they that's just I They own that property and they're like a, You know, they don't refine the oil mean they just have clients like that. So we're just doing like a local like kind of vibe.

[19:14:14 - 19:14:15] Colin Uren: Yes. Yeah.

[19:14:17 - 19:14:26] Scott Davidson: and then, One that might be good for you and I can show you how to do it At some point. I set up an RSS feed on business wire anytime.

[19:14:25 - 19:14:25] Colin Uren: Cool, cool.

[19:14:27 - 19:14:29] Scott Davidson: There's an industrial property acquisition.

[19:14:31 - 19:14:32] Colin Uren: Mmm.

[19:14:31 - 19:15:29] Scott Davidson: I it sends outreach and it's basically, like congrats on XYZ acquisition. You probably are inheriting the assessment and it's probably wrong or something like that. And those tend to be, those could be investors. Like some of them are just like We just invest in industrial real estate. Some of them are like yeah. Third-party logistics. Like stuff like that. Some of them are Refinery is buying other refinery stuff. And then there's also been like, There was one where it was like. Some company that manufacturers, something bought some other manufacturer, so we have ones that we have one for company acquisitions and then one for property acquisitions. And then my thought was just to go down like the whatever they have, you know, four or five different segments that they cover. Okay, first do oil field then go to mining then go to oil and gas then go to but,

[19:15:29 - 19:15:29] Colin Uren: Yeah.

[19:15:30 - 19:15:38] Scott Davidson: yeah, I mean there they've been in business for 26 years and they've just been doing Manual outreach effectively for the whole time or

[19:15:38 - 19:15:40] Colin Uren: Manual. Reaching probably referrals. Yeah, cool.

[19:15:39 - 19:15:40] Scott Davidson: Yeah, a lot of referral. Yeah.

[19:15:41 - 19:16:05] Colin Uren: so, So they're getting you to enrich their, their or, I guess build out a CRM and then enrich the data of everything existing in there and then you you've built out what? Like a cold, email, LinkedIn, DM campaign. Is that what it is? Okay, cool.

[19:16:04 - 19:16:10] Scott Davidson: going in instantly. Yeah, for more volume and yeah we're doing all the list

[19:16:06 - 19:16:06] Colin Uren: Well.

[19:16:06 - 19:16:31] Scott Davidson: We have, we have a LinkedIn campaign in Hay Reach and we have email campaigns building like they have a list of Like 300 customers. That are prospects that they've like Been working kind of over the years. so, and then we're gonna start like trying to make some intros there. But otherwise, We just like reengage that list on LinkedIn and just did like connection only yeah, we're doing all the list building.

[19:16:32 - 19:16:33] Colin Uren: Nice.

[19:16:33 - 19:16:44] Scott Davidson: Like finding the photos and all that jazz. they still don't have a CRM, They don't want to do the CRM until Later, so we're still working. Our endless for now.

[19:16:43 - 19:16:50] Colin Uren: Okay, okay. So you're setting up like just custom workflows for the meantime through, like, for Google sheets, kind of

[19:16:51 - 19:16:54] Scott Davidson: I mean, yeah, the tracking I'm basically doing

[19:16:53 - 19:16:54] Colin Uren: Or excel. I mean,

[19:16:58 - 19:17:01] Scott Davidson: I'm doing tracking externally so like I imported their Google sheet and then I had to enrich it and it was like a mess. So,

[19:17:14 - 19:17:14] Colin Uren: oh,

[19:17:15 - 19:17:50] Scott Davidson: actually have the domain just clip off the domain of the email then enrich that domain and blah and some of them didn't have it and so it was like 300 of the I had to like, yeah, clip off the domain in the email because they didn't 400 had it. And then in terms of like, Tracking outcomes. I'm just using. Instantly is like native reporting and Hey, Rich's native reporting. I'm going to start like hooking in. I have like my API key in cloud code and I'm having it like build a report automatically for me but we're not. Actively like, Oh, we contacted this account six months ago or three months ago, you know? So that that component of a CRM is like absent.

[19:17:49 - 19:18:00] Colin Uren: And are I guess a question I have how how's the email campaign doing? with with Hayridge,

[19:18:04 - 19:18:18] Scott Davidson: So, we just launched. one that actually had outreach recently for oilfield, I mean, it's not no one's worth, it feels like they're a tough group of people to get to respond that persona.

[19:18:20 - 19:18:25] Colin Uren: Yeah, some of them are on LinkedIn and then some of them just have a profile and it's they don't use it.

[19:18:26 - 19:18:29] Scott Davidson: That's my sense. That's my son.

[19:18:29 - 19:18:29] Colin Uren: Yeah.

[19:18:30 - 19:18:49] Scott Davidson: so, he's got I think he sent like, Nine messages. No responses. and then the emails we just launched but it's been like 120 emails with just an out of office.

[19:18:48 - 19:18:51] Colin Uren: Oh, okay, that's nothing yet. Yeah, okay.

[19:18:50 - 19:18:53] Scott Davidson: Yeah. We got to ramp up volume for sure.

[19:18:53 - 19:18:57] Colin Uren: Yeah. so, with

[19:18:56 - 19:19:01] Scott Davidson: but I think we just form their accounts, like, their email accounts are like, just ready to go as of Like this week.

[19:19:01 - 19:19:02] Colin Uren: I see, I see, yeah.

[19:19:03 - 19:19:04] Scott Davidson: President Interesture.

[19:19:05 - 19:19:17] Colin Uren: Yeah. Yeah. Like warm you know up and whatnot. Were you were you scraping lead? Like were you getting the leads from? Are you just searching on like LinkedIn or Apollo like Elite database or

[19:19:20 - 19:19:27] Scott Davidson: The Aboriginal accounts, I'm I'm using, I was using cloud code and I'm also using a tool called Menace Ma and us.

[19:19:26 - 19:19:30] Colin Uren: Yeah, he's been us. I love madness. It's great.

[19:19:38 - 19:20:23] Scott Davidson: Yeah, menace is awesome. Yeah, so I'm using manis, I got like a 200 oil and oil services, in Texas, Bridget, Louisiana and Oklahoma. And then there's native once you get into clay you'll see there's native people. Identification, using the domain? you just type in like the seniority. The So it'll like, it attaches to the domain or LinkedIn. I can't remember. And then It could be like the the title like CFO or if it contains the word like tax in it and then it just brings in the people and then, you know, verification happens. You know after that. So no. I'm not using Apollo we're not using sales now, like it's all native. Play slash like other AI type tools.

[19:20:26 - 19:20:36] Colin Uren: I was good like won't you run out of leads fast? Like because it's like Oh 200 leads to me. I'm like Oh you Go through that like two days or if you're setting, you know? Just like a hundred emails a day kind of thing.

[19:20:36 - 19:20:40] Scott Davidson: That's the problem. Yeah, so I'm that's where I'm running into issues is like,

[19:20:37 - 19:20:38] Colin Uren: Yeah. Okay.

[19:20:41 - 19:20:48] Scott Davidson: How do I build out there? Tam to be bigger and

[19:20:46 - 19:20:47] Colin Uren: Yes. Yeah.

[19:20:50 - 19:20:56] Scott Davidson: More thorough, and I don't know the answer to that right now. but,

[19:20:57 - 19:20:58] Colin Uren: Yeah, because

[19:20:57 - 19:20:58] Scott Davidson: There's probably.

[19:21:01 - 19:21:12] Colin Uren: like, And I'm not an expert in this either. I've just kind of always dabbled on just the outskirts of all this but I know what you're talking about and I know like

[19:21:09 - 19:21:09] Scott Davidson: Mm-hmm.

[19:21:13 - 19:21:16] Colin Uren: Like, how many emails are you guys sending a day? Like how many domains and

[19:21:16 - 19:21:26] Scott Davidson: right now we have, we only have four And then we have Microsoft accounts. Warming. So within a week or two, we'll probably have

[19:21:24 - 19:21:25] Colin Uren: Yes. Yeah.

[19:21:28 - 19:21:29] Scott Davidson: Eight or nine, maybe 10.

[19:21:30 - 19:21:36] Colin Uren: It or not, you're not addresses and you want to send like what 30, emails a day. Or less.

[19:21:37 - 19:21:42] Scott Davidson: Yeah, I mean we'll probably spend 10 from each of them, so maybe 10 or 15 from

[19:21:38 - 19:21:39] Colin Uren: 10. Okay.

[19:21:40 - 19:21:43] Scott Davidson: each of them. And yeah, so we'll be doing 100 easy. A day.

[19:21:43 - 19:21:58] Colin Uren: so then it's like how do you find like 3,000 leads a month. Basically, for email. If and they don't. So how does this work? Like you they don't want to get the

[19:21:52 - 19:21:52] Scott Davidson: Mmm.

[19:21:58 - 19:22:05] Colin Uren: leads from sales never Apollo or You just you? Yeah. Like what

[19:22:05 - 19:22:08] Scott Davidson: They don't, yeah, they don't. So they do have zoom, info license.

[19:22:11 - 19:22:12] Colin Uren: Okay, yeah, I know. So

[19:22:12 - 19:22:26] Scott Davidson: So we can actually, I need to do that this way, so that's a good reminder. I want to hook into their zoom info and Do some research that way. We've done. I got this free. A free three months for this tool called Sumble Su and Ble.

[19:22:27 - 19:22:29] Colin Uren: Okay, I haven't heard of that one yet. Okay.

[19:22:28 - 19:23:02] Scott Davidson: It's pretty cool. It tracks. Um, It might be useful for you, I'm not sure it tracks. The presence of technologies in Job postings. management tool, you can look up like jobs in the US that are hiring in Texas So like if they've mentioned the Dynamics 365 or whatever the you know Project that have mentioned that tool within the last 30 days. And that gives you a list of like companies, so I did that for people hiring

[19:23:00 - 19:23:00] Colin Uren: Twitter.

[19:23:02 - 19:23:17] Scott Davidson: tax. Director and above. In a handful of industries in the last 30 days. So, we just started that one and then I know there's like, Native, find companies in clay. so,

[19:23:17 - 19:23:32] Colin Uren: Yeah, I was just going to come to that but I know they did cost more credits than like just. Like from what whatever followed in the community in the past like years, people will go into Apollo. And then basically use like

[19:23:42 - 19:23:47] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:23:52 - 19:23:58] Colin Uren: A chrome extension to be able to export more contacts or just more contacts without having to buy the like the pro version of Apollo and they always patch it and then like a new one comes out and then they export You know whatever it do enrichment through clay. So I didn't know if that maybe something to is like 5,000 leads to like you're just basic list and then from there they'll

[19:23:58 - 19:24:01] Scott Davidson: Yeah. I mean that we awesome. I think that

[19:24:00 - 19:24:00] Colin Uren: Consider.

[19:24:02 - 19:24:13] Scott Davidson: If I recall correctly, they've gotten shut down recently and it's in a period of shutdown. So I don't know if right now we can do it. But yeah, I mean, I think something

[19:24:08 - 19:24:13] Colin Uren: Okay. Yeah.

[19:24:13 - 19:24:16] Scott Davidson: we can Definitely go to.

[19:24:26 - 19:24:38] Colin Uren: Can you, scrape Lee, can you scrape connections of just being on a regular LinkedIn account? Because I'm just thinking my father, like we use his LinkedIn account for everything, basically, for or just organic posting, and he is 18,000 Contacts in there.

[19:24:37 - 19:24:40] Scott Davidson: Hmm. Okay.

[19:24:41 - 19:24:45] Colin Uren: Yeah, and I'm just thinking like I don't know, maybe that's another way.

[19:24:41 - 19:24:46] Scott Davidson: Maybe. Hmm.

[19:24:48 - 19:24:53] Colin Uren: And I just for myself, too, like, that's another way to to scrape contacts into like an actual list. One sec.

[19:24:55 - 19:24:58] Scott Davidson: Yeah, I think you can do it with a tool. You might be able to do it with a tool called Phantom Buster.

[19:24:58 - 19:25:02] Colin Uren: Yes. Yeah, yeah. Fantas plus or probably something on apply

[19:25:00 - 19:25:08] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah, maybe yeah, I did a small job on Upwork for it was their own followers.

[19:25:10 - 19:25:11] Colin Uren: Okay.

[19:25:12 - 19:25:25] Scott Davidson: And they had like a lot. Yeah, 11,000 I think And they just wanted info, that was like there you know, database or in a worksheet. So um I know can do your own. I just don't do others.

[19:25:26 - 19:25:29] Colin Uren: Yeah, there must there's there's probably a way I mean.

[19:25:28 - 19:25:37] Scott Davidson: But that's again. Yeah, there must be. But I'm gonna look at that.

[19:25:39 - 19:25:53] Colin Uren: Yes, how to export? Then. All hours from. Persons. How do you like mayonnaise since the metabio?

[19:25:54 - 19:25:56] Scott Davidson: I just started using it.

[19:25:57 - 19:25:57] Colin Uren: I did, okay.

[19:26:07 - 19:26:12] Scott Davidson: I used it. I used it like a while ago like many many months ago and I was like, Okay, whatever. Um, and then I tried it the other day and I mean, I think I'm just digging into it. Like, I just use it twice but it seems very powerful. How about you?

[19:26:13 - 19:26:53] Colin Uren: Yeah, I came across it last March. This is when it Was still new, but it was just kind of like breaking out and I'd been testing models. To build like a project. project schedule from scratch, like, Here's all my 15 contractors like my electricians. My framers like And I want to build a 60 story or 60 unit or story apartment building. I want to have you know this this I want to two layers of underground parking. And Manus was the one that produced the most accurate schedule.

[19:26:54 - 19:26:54] Scott Davidson: Well.

[19:26:55 - 19:27:05] Colin Uren: It produced like a 200 task schedule, but it was very it was just very accurate in the dependencies from

[19:27:05 - 19:27:07] Scott Davidson: Well.

[19:27:10 - 19:27:22] Colin Uren: Different deliverables, compared to like a chat, gbt or cloud at that time. And I remember Manus was the very first like, Agent that I'd use because it, you know, you type something in and then it would show you all the sources. I was like, this thing is crazy.

[19:27:20 - 19:27:24] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:27:25 - 19:27:39] Colin Uren: But I just haven't tinkered with it to too much. I'll go in there. Here and there I got a perplexity pro account for free for a year. As well, PayPal had this promotion, and a link.

[19:28:12 - 19:29:06] Scott Davidson: Yeah, no, I think they're I think, yeah. So I've used perplexity in like Hitting the API in clay and being like, here's this company. tell me like recent news about them that I can like reference in an email or something um, and it's been good for that and then Claude I use for um, like I have like a repo that Kind of just has like all my context. Like, I put transcripts in there for my calls. I put Resources, I see about like how to write a good email. better. Like a gently going in like doing stuff for you, right? So are you Just whatever.

[19:29:43 - 19:29:43] Scott Davidson: Right.

[19:29:44 - 19:30:01] Colin Uren: We have worked with. Smaller developers. Well, should you say smaller we? I mean these guys were building like, I don't know. 100 Unit apartment buildings. So I mean I don't know how much those are five to ten million. Let's call it maybe.

[19:30:03 - 19:30:06] Scott Davidson: Yeah, probably.

[19:30:03 - 19:31:04] Colin Uren: Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. But we were never good enough to really segment things and then track what we were doing and that sort of thing. So We've been kind of all over the place. We like we sold the software too. We actually We were working with a form, is it? First form work company. So doing the whole foundation and the the rebar for an apartment building he did really well, he came a month ahead of schedule. Which was? Like amazing, like he he his boss there's the reason why we got a meeting with his boss because his boss was like I've never seen someone in. For more come in on schedule, let alone a month, I had a schedule. So we've just been pivoting and trying new things. It's just been kind of All over the place but I'm happy.
