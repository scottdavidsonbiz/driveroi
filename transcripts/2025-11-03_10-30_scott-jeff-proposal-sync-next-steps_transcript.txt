[19:00:00 - 19:00:00] Jeffrey Cohen: Speakers were muted. So I couldn't hear right away.

[19:00:00 - 19:00:03] Scott Davidson: I said I was just saying good morning. How are you?

[19:00:03 - 19:00:05] Jeffrey Cohen: I'm doing well.

[19:00:04 - 19:00:06] Scott Davidson: Nice.

[19:00:05 - 19:00:11] Jeffrey Cohen: Just getting getting everything running to start the day.

[19:00:10 - 19:00:13] Scott Davidson: Here. Yeah, beginning of the week. Did you have a good weekend?

[19:00:13 - 19:00:27] Jeffrey Cohen: We did we? We went to the the UT game against Vanderbilt on. Saturday morning and first three, quarters were great and then

[19:00:23 - 19:00:24] Scott Davidson: Nice.

[19:00:27 - 19:00:46] Jeffrey Cohen: Some combination of defense getting wax because of the the lead that we had and some really bad calls by officials getting the team set off. But we held on to him, so that was good. And then got a nice long run in

[19:00:40 - 19:00:43] Scott Davidson: Oh, hey.

[19:00:43 - 19:00:49] Jeffrey Cohen: yesterday. It was it was a good weekend, nice and quiet. Other than that.

[19:00:47 - 19:00:51] Scott Davidson: Nice. Nice. Are you a runner?

[19:00:52 - 19:01:05] Jeffrey Cohen: I am I Well, I'm not fast but I'm consistent and I'm stubborn. So I keep putting one foot in front of the other. I've done about

[19:01:04 - 19:01:05] Scott Davidson: There.

[19:01:06 - 19:01:18] Jeffrey Cohen: 20ish Marathons and a number of halves and I'm starting to, I guess ramp up

[19:01:08 - 19:01:09] Scott Davidson: Wow.

[19:01:13 - 19:01:18] Jeffrey Cohen: because I have Houston in January coming up and then Austin in February next year.

[19:01:18 - 19:01:28] Scott Davidson: Nice. That's awesome. Yeah, my mom's a big runner. I've done. I've done a couple halves but she's the She mostly does house now but she's on a couple marathons.

[19:01:29 - 19:01:51] Jeffrey Cohen: Halves are like over the last 50 15 years that I've been doing this. I've determined. Yeah, halfs are really like that sweet spot because you still feel really accomplished finishing it. But you can be done in two two and a half hours and not have pain for three or four days afterwards.

[19:01:46 - 19:02:01] Scott Davidson: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I've never done more than 13.1 but I don't want to go a lot further, I think at some point in my life I have to do a marathon just to do it but

[19:02:01 - 19:02:03] Jeffrey Cohen: So, it's

[19:02:01 - 19:02:04] Scott Davidson: Yeah, no interest in doing substantially for the

[19:02:03 - 19:02:19] Jeffrey Cohen: I say it's funny. The whole point that when I started is, I wanted to do a half before I was 30 because uh, like that would feel accomplished and I felt like those people that do 26 are just crazy. Like that's not and I had a buddy of mine who at that

[19:02:16 - 19:02:17] Scott Davidson: Exactly.

[19:02:18 - 19:02:48] Jeffrey Cohen: point had done one, maybe two false and he was like You're gonna cross the finish line and you're gonna say that wasn't so bad. If you do a half you could do a full and I said, There's no way it's not gonna happen that like, I'm gonna feel good. I'm gonna feel done and I'll be done and then I cross the finish line and I was like that wasn't so bad. If I could do a half, I could do a full I guess. And so I signed up the next year to do the Houston full marathon with

[19:02:40 - 19:02:41] Scott Davidson: Okay. Yeah.

[19:02:44 - 19:02:53] Jeffrey Cohen: him. And then we get to the start line at Houston and he goes so you thought you could do a After doing a half, huh? And I said, Yeah, and it goes, I can't believe you bought that b*******.

[19:02:54 - 19:02:56] Scott Davidson: That's funny. That's fine.

[19:02:55 - 19:02:58] Jeffrey Cohen: And then around mile 18, it started to get real.

[19:02:58 - 19:03:17] Scott Davidson: Oh, yeah, I bet, I bet that's what I've kind of heard, I know. Um, Richmond, is this weekend, this coming weekend, there's a hat an AK, which is random which

[19:03:04 - 19:03:05] Jeffrey Cohen: Mm-hmm.

[19:03:08 - 19:03:17] Scott Davidson: I've done before and a half, which I've done twice, and then the full, which I haven't done. But yeah, it's, it's got a good turnout and it's fun. So,

[19:03:16 - 19:03:29] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, I saw New York was Sunday and it made me a little wanting to do it again

[19:03:18 - 19:03:20] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:03:22 - 19:03:29] Jeffrey Cohen: because we did that back in 2017 and that was one of the coolest races I've ever done. So I would like to do it again. But

[19:03:26 - 19:03:31] Scott Davidson: Nice. That'll be fun.

[19:03:30 - 19:03:32] Jeffrey Cohen: to apply for the lottery and have to hope to get

[19:03:31 - 19:03:34] Scott Davidson: Hard to get into, right? Yeah, yeah.

[19:03:32 - 19:03:33] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:03:35 - 19:03:46] Scott Davidson: Yeah, no. My mom did New York, like When I was like 10 or something, you know, a long time ago, so we got to go and

[19:03:41 - 19:03:48] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:03:42 - 19:04:13] Scott Davidson: it was fun when I was that age. So I got to kind of hang out. Nice awesome. All right, so I went through your email and the things, I think he wanted to tackle. I put something together, which we can look at, but I kind of wanted to get a sense of I'm Like your decision criteria and timeline like, you know, what are you thinking? Did the other partners like need to be involved or you know, all those sorts of things.

[19:04:13 - 19:04:36] Jeffrey Cohen: Hmm, I definitely would like to get James and Jen involved. I shared that are with them the the information that you sent via email and we talked a little bit on Thursday and Friday, I did also have a A conversation with another gentleman

[19:04:23 - 19:04:24] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:04:29 - 19:05:56] Jeffrey Cohen: that was here in the Austin area who we talked about some very similar things. But the only difference I'd say between the feedback that I got from him and the feedback that I got from you is that he had specific kind of numbers attached to our initial conversation. Um and so we we could put like well this is kind of the budgeting idea that we have. So I definitely think it's something that I'd like to continue talking with you about Scott and seeing what kind of What kind of path forward that we can make? As I kind of said in my First, or I guess my response. Your email is. What was it that the first couple things that you had mentioned in your email, the, the strategic foundation about finding that ideal customer profile. And and Basically kind of pushing everything towards, okay, we have a list of the type of companies and type of people that were going for and then getting that information put in and then using that as into the second part, which was the execution of doing that outbound messaging via LinkedIn, etc. Those are the things that I think right off the bat we would like to try to focus on and then

[19:05:44 - 19:05:45] Scott Davidson: Hmm. Yeah.

[19:05:44 - 19:06:21] Jeffrey Cohen: kind of like what we had discussed and you said in your email we could look at, you know, attaching the lightweight CRM to kind of for a place our spreadsheet and then do it that afterwards. But like you said pushing everything together, getting an idea of of cost and putting that two weeks burnt together and then doing a review, every two weeks to see how we're doing. If we're gonna do something, which I definitely think we need to do something, I'd like to get started. Before the end of the year, I know with the holidays coming up, that that does kind of push things around a little bit.

[19:06:21 - 19:06:31] Scott Davidson: Yeah, no. Totally when you set a number from the other person where you sent did you mean like cop investment or did you mean okay?

[19:06:29 - 19:07:19] Jeffrey Cohen: Exactly. So he would we talked a little bit about like I said, a lot of the same kinds of things and he said, like, you know, a cold email infrastructure costs X doing the push to whether it's via LinkedIn, Google ad services, or something like meta, and Facebook costs about I think he said like one to two or two or one thousand to 2500 a month depending on what you're doing. So he said, realistically putting everything together, you're talking somewhere between like 3000 and 10,000 a month. I would hope that we would be on the lower side of that to start off until we can really get the ball rolling but I think that kind of

[19:07:07 - 19:07:08] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:07:09 - 19:07:19] Jeffrey Cohen: depends. So that's kind of He was just kind of saying based on his experience

[19:07:10 - 19:07:11] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:07:15 - 19:07:19] Jeffrey Cohen: that kind of thing that he was seeing though one of the

[19:07:15 - 19:07:16] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:07:20 - 19:07:45] Jeffrey Cohen: The caveats that I had with my meeting with him is that he has traditionally worked more in the software as a service space. And The. Technology space as opposed to the service industry space that we're working. And so I didn't know how Relatable that connection would be and that cost could be.

[19:07:45 - 19:08:04] Scott Davidson: Yeah, I mean I think some of the it and so yeah I can get into I'll get into my presentation and right here. So, let me one second. Because yeah, that you know there are variable costs associated with infrastructure. That it kind of

[19:08:02 - 19:08:03] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:08:04 - 19:08:17] Scott Davidson: We don't know. It sounds like with the information we have right now but we can we can try and figure out what it is. So let me go ahead and For what it might look like, at least.

[19:08:16 - 19:08:17] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:08:17 - 19:08:22] Scott Davidson: That's what you're here. Is that good to go through this? Does that work? Okay,

[19:08:20 - 19:08:29] Jeffrey Cohen: Absolutely. Yeah. And I'll take some notes and then I'll talk about this with I

[19:08:22 - 19:08:22] Scott Davidson: cool.

[19:08:26 - 19:08:49] Jeffrey Cohen: know Jen and James are going to Massachusetts tomorrow and they'll be gone through Thursday. So it probably

[19:08:32 - 19:08:40] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:08:36 - 19:08:49] Jeffrey Cohen: won't be able to get to them till Friday, but if we can talk about it Friday, I'd love to try to schedule something with you next week after and maybe get all

[19:08:42 - 19:08:43] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:08:45 - 19:08:49] Jeffrey Cohen: of us in a room and we can discuss kind of going forward.

[19:08:48 - 19:09:05] Scott Davidson: Okay, yeah, that sounds great. Okay, so yeah. This is just a, an overview of what we're trying to accomplish here. So try and you know, get some momentum before the tax season bidding window and then of course set up some

[19:09:02 - 19:09:03] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:09:05 - 19:09:14] Scott Davidson: Like the infrastructure like CRM etc. And some of the workflows to kind of continue the progress and continue to see next year.

[19:09:11 - 19:09:13] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, perfect.

[19:09:15 - 19:09:49] Scott Davidson: let's see, what Let's go back. Okay. So yeah, current situation and challenges, you know, needing to expand the tactics. Tool usage. Like zoom info is expensive and not great, at least at intent, certain for certain. I haven't gotten in there, but I think, you know, you can leverage that tool still within some of the workflows that I'll be talking about since paying for it. It'll actually make some of the other tooling.

[19:09:43 - 19:09:45] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:09:49 - 19:09:51] Scott Davidson: More efficient or cheaper at least.

[19:09:51 - 19:09:52] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:09:53 - 19:09:59] Scott Davidson: And then this relates to some of the manual processes with Google Sheets and Manual Review.

[19:09:59 - 19:10:09] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:10:00 - 19:10:43] Scott Davidson: And then there can see around the tax season and Trying to identify high intent prospects. Like we talked about So yeah, as you mentioned there would be a pretty quick sprint up front. To develop. The ICP and personas. Looking at your closed, one deals. And to the extent, you have tracked closed loss deals, too. You know, we can, There are a lot of look-alike We can use a look-alike software that helps identify companies that would like, fall into You know this world and we would work, we would go live and do it and you can use thumbs up thumbs down and it'll spit out an ICP list for us.

[19:10:42 - 19:10:49] Jeffrey Cohen: So when you say closed lost deals is that ones that we've had meetings with and they've decided to go another direction.

[19:10:49 - 19:11:01] Scott Davidson: yeah, I mean to the extent, you you have that and you know, Why? Or have an idea why they might have decided to go a different direction that can all be helpful, but it's not necessary.

[19:10:58 - 19:11:08] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay. Okay, I just wanted to make sure I was understanding the the verbage that you're

[19:11:04 - 19:11:04] Scott Davidson: Oh yeah.

[19:11:06 - 19:11:08] Jeffrey Cohen: using.

[19:11:07 - 19:11:18] Scott Davidson: Yeah, sorry, yeah. So close one is you won the business and close losses. You

[19:11:10 - 19:11:11] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:11:10 - 19:11:18] Scott Davidson: lost it. And that's something I'll get into in a little bit later that probably

[19:11:14 - 19:11:15] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:11:14 - 19:11:24] Scott Davidson: come into Phase. Two of You know, there's like the tactics like emailing and all that good stuff, but

[19:11:22 - 19:11:22] Jeffrey Cohen: M.

[19:11:23 - 19:11:53] Scott Davidson: then there's the data-driven component, which is You know, a lot of most companies include staging so you would you would say, You know, a stage one deal as we have a meeting schedule. The stage two deal is, it's a qualified account, etc, etc. And stage five, or whatever you make it is closed one. And then there's a stage for close lost and you would just give a reasoning to the extent possible. And that would help us further refine, you

[19:11:49 - 19:11:51] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:11:51 - 19:11:53] Scott Davidson: know, the messaging and the tactics.

[19:11:53 - 19:11:54] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:11:55 - 19:12:11] Scott Davidson: so, we'd find that list and this goes back to You know, how big is that list? Like how many accounts are there that are total, addressable market like What is it? And I don't know the answer Right now. Maybe you have like a semblance of an idea of what that might look like.

[19:12:09 - 19:12:16] Jeffrey Cohen: Oh, I mean I do I don't know if that list is going to be ever complete because there's

[19:12:16 - 19:12:17] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:12:17 - 19:12:33] Jeffrey Cohen: Thousands of whether it's small business, or large companies out there that we could have potentially work for. I think our current lists and the ones that we've been going on have At least. A couple hundred to a few thousand.

[19:12:32 - 19:12:34] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:12:33 - 19:12:35] Jeffrey Cohen: Companies listed.

[19:12:35 - 19:12:54] Scott Davidson: Okay, cool. Okay, that's good to know. Um, and then, Yeah, we would, as mentioned segment, those into tears of based on priority and what we think is the most likely to close and again, using the closed one history to inform that and then the ongoing data as we progress,

[19:12:54 - 19:12:55] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:12:55 - 19:13:14] Scott Davidson: And then we would use a mixture of All these data sources like Firmographics, you know, how many employees do they have? How many locations thing, you know, whatever is relevant? We would we would figure that out and develop specific messaging to both the persona and

[19:13:09 - 19:13:10] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:13:14 - 19:14:04] Scott Davidson: The type of company. So if it's a CO versus the tax leader versus some other type of person, And then, I My recommendation and we can change this. Is that we Include the, the 10K automated research up front and not the social listening component. Like seeing what people are talking about on LinkedIn, just because Well, I guess you could tell me but I would want its less cost because you're already using the existing infrastructure that we'll talk about an AI which is substantially cheaper than buying a purpose made tool for Social Listening. It's the social listening tool isn't very expensive, it's like Hundred a month or 150 a month, like, you know, it's nothing crazy. Um, but

[19:14:02 - 19:14:03] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:14:05 - 19:14:27] Scott Davidson: I don't know the free and there's a 14-day trial so we can use it and see what happens. But I don't know the frequency at which some of these things are talking about and that might be like an incremental push rather than If 10K, methodology is proven to be, helpful or other public databases then you know that maybe we leverage that

[19:14:21 - 19:14:22] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:14:25 - 19:15:02] Scott Davidson: first but you know you tell me Um, so yeah, that would be two weeks quick sprint. Try and get all these things ready for the execution, which comes next. And that looks like, Taking the Tier 1 accounts that we will use a scoring logic that will work together to determine what constitutes high account, highly scored accounts, and highly scored people. And then we will. Target them with LinkedIn first because you will should expect substantially higher reply rates with LinkedIn.

[19:15:03 - 19:15:06] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay. That was kind of what I was thinking. Yeah.

[19:15:03 - 19:15:33] Scott Davidson: The. yeah, the downside of LinkedIn is that Each individual can only send 25 connection requests and about 40 messages without getting. Blocked her. A flag from LinkedIn. Potentially. So we could add all your

[19:15:19 - 19:15:20] Jeffrey Cohen: Mmm.

[19:15:21 - 19:15:33] Scott Davidson: partners or anyone. And it would just consolidate all the inbox into one inbox that we could manage centrally, and it would only cover those messages. So, only ones associated with the outbound campaigns,

[19:15:32 - 19:15:51] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay. And that was one of the questions that I had for you. Following up a conversation that we had last time is I know that you mentioned, they have that limit to like, would it be say 25 messages from me. 25 messages from Jen 25 from

[19:15:45 - 19:15:47] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:15:46 - 19:15:51] Jeffrey Cohen: James or it would be a generic account that's pulling together, all of them.

[19:15:50 - 19:15:52] Scott Davidson: No, no, it's you. It's you

[19:15:52 - 19:15:53] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:15:53 - 19:16:10] Scott Davidson: Um yeah, it it just cycles through based on the quantity and it just. Yeah I mean I think maybe able to set some rules around it but no it would just go through your individual account. So we would connect you of your account up and then yeah, it just rotates through the senders.

[19:16:10 - 19:16:12] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:16:14 - 19:16:35] Scott Davidson: and then we would Target specific individuals and again have Custom personalized messaging based on Those parameters. And then we would push the next tranches over to email, which is good for

[19:16:32 - 19:16:33] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:16:34 - 19:17:29] Scott Davidson: volume. But lower reply rates. On. We can still be super personalized and hope that should help with the reply rates. And You know, sometimes it takes a couple campaigns, you probably, you don't want to really reach out to the same individual. Like, you want to space the campaigns out 60 to 90 days, but you can do like three or four touches on per campaign. so, that's a good way to Get, you know, some level of engagement there. And then, Yeah, we can we can use intent to help. Personalize like we can look at job changes. So new folks, we can look at him

[19:17:21 - 19:17:42] Jeffrey Cohen: I guess one question, I know that James specifically would have regarding the

[19:17:21 - 19:17:29] Scott Davidson: and a activity and again, the 10ks and any public information and incorporate that into the messaging, which should help a lot with the reply rates.

[19:17:36 - 19:18:04] Jeffrey Cohen: connections per day per team member is have you had or known of I guess, bad publicity. That's come from specific users sending data like that or requests or information. Through LinkedIn. Because I know that's something that he's always worried about. He's like, Well, if we're out there, spamming people, are they going to get turned off from us?

[19:18:03 - 19:18:18] Scott Davidson: Yeah. With this with the messaging in LinkedIn. It's so You can't we would write the messages in such a way that you really can't tell that it's automated like it's very we can make it very personalized.

[19:18:14 - 19:18:19] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay. Okay.

[19:18:19 - 19:18:29] Scott Davidson: And at 25, I mean, LinkedIn is never gonna fly you an individual, you know, at

[19:18:22 - 19:18:34] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:18:25 - 19:19:02] Scott Davidson: worst they just they probably won't accept the request in the first place or they'll just ignore you. I mean, I've never, I've never had a problem really heard of anything and there are people that do this with a lot of scale emails. You know, there's do not you can unfill or unsubscribe and there's do not contact lists and and same thing. If someone says on LinkedIn, like contact me anymore, we create a centralized database of anyone that's ever done that, that we can reference and make sure not to contact them again. But yeah, people tend to especially if they're business owners or CFOs and stuff. I mean they get pitched all day, so they kind of are used to it, I think.

[19:19:02 - 19:19:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, that makes sense.

[19:19:07 - 19:19:22] Scott Davidson: all right, so The timeline looks like setting up that initial foundation a couple weeks after that. We want to get the first bits of outreach going and then hope it will be

[19:19:19 - 19:19:21] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:19:22 - 19:19:25] Scott Davidson: Seeing some level of momentum and meeting conversions.

[19:19:26 - 19:19:27] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:19:27 - 19:19:52] Scott Davidson: You know, within the first month or two months and then we'll use bi-weekly reviews of the campaign metrics to help. You know, we can one we can A/b test a B, A to Z test in the email and you know, test what subject lines are working. What? First lines are working things like that, so we can iterate as we go.

[19:19:54 - 19:19:55] Jeffrey Cohen: Hmm.

[19:19:55 - 19:20:05] Scott Davidson: Typical benchmarks are. First, you look at how many people accept your invite your request to connect and that's something like.

[19:20:04 - 19:20:06] Jeffrey Cohen: Really.

[19:20:07 - 19:20:32] Scott Davidson: 30 to 50% of outreach. And then of that. 20 to 30%, reply. Not all of those will be positive replies but pretty high, and then compared to Five to ten percent email reply, which includes out of offices and don't ever contact me again. So, you know, 5% is is pretty good for email. And that's why LinkedIn is, you know, substantially

[19:20:31 - 19:20:32] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:20:32 - 19:21:05] Scott Davidson: Better for our high. or high target prospects and then Positive, yeah. Positive response rate, you know 30 to 50% depending on what the offer offer is and we'll talk about crafting an offer we can, you know, I don't know if there's We can do case studies. Like if you've --. Do you find like savings is that the or is it a Is it a compliance type of like what differentiates one provider versus another?

[19:21:06 - 19:21:24] Jeffrey Cohen: I I say it's a little bit of both, there's definitely things on the compliance

[19:21:09 - 19:21:09] Scott Davidson: oh,

[19:21:10 - 19:21:31] Jeffrey Cohen: side that I think that we do differently, whether it's classification of assets or actually. I know there's a lot of the larger companies that are doing, basically, desktop valuations, so they're not going to the sites. We're going to visit the sites or going to determine specific issues that are there whether or

[19:21:26 - 19:21:26] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:21:31 - 19:22:05] Jeffrey Cohen: not there's ability at those sites for exemptions based on new Capex, whether it's pollution control, whether it's inventory management. We're going to work with the jurisdictions and the clients team, find those things and make sure that we're getting all applicable ones. So all of that's going to be on the compliance side, but then that leads again to the valuation side. So once we

[19:21:57 - 19:21:59] Scott Davidson: Mean.

[19:21:58 - 19:22:12] Jeffrey Cohen: start kind of putting that information together, we're going to determine how it would affect the value and their we would Yet potential reductions potential tax savings. So we do have a lot of

[19:22:09 - 19:22:10] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:22:12 - 19:22:16] Jeffrey Cohen: historical data that we can use for those kind of case studies. And I think

[19:22:16 - 19:22:17] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:22:17 - 19:22:33] Jeffrey Cohen: that's one of the things that we've talked about internally kind of putting on LinkedIn as some of those case studies. So people can see the amount of savings

[19:22:23 - 19:22:23] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:22:26 - 19:22:33] Jeffrey Cohen: that we've received for, you know, one client in giving year or one location

[19:22:30 - 19:22:58] Scott Davidson: So, that's certainly would help and that's one of the. Yeah, I mean, if you

[19:22:30 - 19:22:33] Jeffrey Cohen: here, some of those really big wins.

[19:22:38 - 19:23:12] Scott Davidson: start doing that then that's where that tool, that was kind of talking about earlier, Triggerify can come into play, you can look at other people's posts and mentions of a topic and thought leaders etc, but also look at who's engaging

[19:22:49 - 19:22:56] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:22:50 - 19:23:12] Scott Davidson: with your content and and push them into these like a LinkedIn campaign, for example. Um, so that's a good way to do it. But even within the email body, like you know, we want to be speaking to an offer, welcome to what the Copywriting

[19:23:02 - 19:23:03] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:23:04 - 19:23:52] Scott Davidson: looks like. But usually, you know, hundred to 150 words with just like very to the point and including yeah, some sort of case study, or Something like that. It is is typically like a really good way to To go. and then our target ratio, For any given campaign except for LinkedIn, because LinkedIn has substantially lower volume. So we should expect a much better rate than this. But if we're in the one to 500 to 750 range of, individuals contacted One meeting booked per individual per 500, individual contacted. We know we're like on the right path and we're gonna look to whittle that down to 400 ish 300 50, something like that. Again in LinkedIn, it will be substantially lower than that.

[19:23:49 - 19:24:09] Jeffrey Cohen: So, that's That's based on like, the email reply rate of 500. So if we if we are sorry,

[19:23:55 - 19:23:56] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:23:58 - 19:24:09] Jeffrey Cohen: five percent. So if we contact, um, 500 people on email and we get a response, 25 and meetings that's kind of that one in 500.

[19:24:09 - 19:24:33] Scott Davidson: Exactly. Yeah, you've cascade all the percentages and then You know, you can do multitouch. So like we can email with people that we linked in, we can call the people that we email and LinkedIn and that'll help as well. So yeah, there's ways to but that's a good target to understand. If the messaging itself like the offer in the case study in the order in which we're saying things like is On the right track.

[19:24:32 - 19:24:34] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:24:33 - 19:24:40] Scott Davidson: And usually batches of like 2000 for email is like where we can get is a good sample size.

[19:24:40 - 19:24:41] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:24:40 - 19:24:45] Scott Davidson: And any questions on this one?

[19:24:45 - 19:24:53] Jeffrey Cohen: Not so far that's um I have to say the one in 500. Kind of scares me a little

[19:24:46 - 19:24:48] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:24:50 - 19:24:53] Jeffrey Cohen: bit.

[19:24:50 - 19:24:58] Scott Davidson: I know, I know, I know, I know it. I think for LinkedIn. It'll be substantially lower than that.

[19:24:56 - 19:24:58] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:24:59 - 19:25:14] Scott Davidson: and, you know, Part of it is. You know, are they qualified or not? So, you know, you may have had the meetings

[19:25:05 - 19:25:06] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:25:06 - 19:25:28] Scott Davidson: in the past that they didn't go anywhere. So we're targeting for them to like, be qualified upfront, and that'll just help the downstream funnel metrics like from qualified meeting to close. But yeah, I just put that as a conservative number because I don't want to like, over promise something, but I expect it to

[19:25:21 - 19:25:26] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:25:26 - 19:25:28] Scott Davidson: be better than this.

[19:25:28 - 19:25:29] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:25:29 - 19:25:55] Scott Davidson: So let's see, this would be the future state, so, We can do a lightweight CRM implementation. We can get into, which ones make the most sense. They're ones that don't even charge per seat and they charge based on like work. Because they're AI based there's ones that have really substantial

[19:25:43 - 19:25:43] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:25:47 - 19:25:55] Scott Davidson: way cheaper than Enterprise solutions Percy costs. And you have a total of 15 folks or

[19:25:55 - 19:26:26] Jeffrey Cohen: Currently. Yeah, I think we have Let's see. Let me do it really quick count. So, See. Yeah, about 15.

[19:26:26 - 19:26:34] Scott Davidson: okay, so yeah, I mean I think Some of them are 20 to 30 bucks, a seat per month and you know, it's not too

[19:26:32 - 19:26:34] Jeffrey Cohen: okay, I mean, I know

[19:26:32 - 19:26:34] Scott Davidson: bad.

[19:26:35 - 19:26:48] Jeffrey Cohen: Less than that, 15 would actually be using the CRM. So, that's fair like that.

[19:26:39 - 19:26:41] Scott Davidson: oh, well, that

[19:26:40 - 19:26:48] Jeffrey Cohen: 15 includes, you know, our taxable payment processing, and our desk etc.

[19:26:45 - 19:27:24] Scott Davidson: Okay. Got you. Okay, um, yes, so so we would look into that. There's workflow automations that are built into some of the crms and then we can build, you know, ones that are bespoke to your needs. But something like, Okay, they engage with your content, push them into a LinkedIn campaign and then having a CRM,

[19:27:04 - 19:27:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Hmm.

[19:27:07 - 19:27:56] Scott Davidson: that's not based in Google Sheet would allow us to do some tracking of the metric, the stage progress in average sales cycle days, things like that to help us, you know, further segment and just be more efficient and hopefully push that meeting number, you know, down. Or up meeting number up, you know, contacts per the fever. This would be part Yeah if we add the enhanced lead scoring. So some things like the social monitoring with that tool. Other tool I mentioned if there are you know we can incorporate other public records databases. Etc. And not all just kind of automate the research and make things a lot easier to just review and then decide where we want to send things.

[19:27:56 - 19:27:57] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:27:57 - 19:28:08] Scott Davidson: This would be. you would pay for the technology costs and what that looks like is The email automation platform is $97 a month?

[19:28:08 - 19:28:10] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:28:09 - 19:28:21] Scott Davidson: Based on the volume which we would determine after the list. You would need domains, which are cheap one time and then three dollars fifty per month per inbox. You can send

[19:28:20 - 19:28:25] Jeffrey Cohen: So, that's from our current domain and email inboxes.

[19:28:25 - 19:28:29] Scott Davidson: I wouldn't send them from your personal domain. Yeah.

[19:28:28 - 19:28:31] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, that's fair.

[19:28:30 - 19:28:46] Scott Davidson: Yeah, because you don't want to get flagged and then all your emails will end up in spam. So we create we can do like a forwarding address. It'll get forwarded

[19:28:33 - 19:28:35] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, that's true.

[19:28:36 - 19:28:46] Scott Davidson: to you or use those workflow automations to like categorize. Oh this is interest

[19:28:40 - 19:28:40] Jeffrey Cohen: Gotcha.

[19:28:40 - 19:28:46] Scott Davidson: interested and then send it to you. So you like a bunch of hey buzz off emails.

[19:28:42 - 19:28:47] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay. Okay.

[19:28:46 - 19:29:18] Scott Davidson: off emails, um, So you need, you can do five emails per inbox first. Sorry, five, emails. Sorry, five email accounts. Per domain. So depending on the size of N, you can send 25 to 30 emails per day per email inbox. so, depending on the volume, you know, if you're set, I say I can send 900 a day and I have 30 Inboxes over six domain, I have five per domain and I have six domains so it's not super duper expensive.

[19:29:18 - 19:29:19] Jeffrey Cohen: Gotcha.

[19:29:19 - 19:29:46] Scott Davidson: Um, an email verification tool. You just run it through. And it, it's like a couple sentence per email, verification. To the extent. It's a same same company, you know, we can not use the email verification and if I already have the email which I probably wouldn't, then we wouldn't need to do that but

[19:29:45 - 19:29:46] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:29:46 - 19:29:51] Scott Davidson: The LinkedIn is 79 per month per account.

[19:29:50 - 19:29:51] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:29:51 - 19:30:04] Scott Davidson: There's a 14-day free trial where you can add unlimited accounts so we can set up your first campaign for free basically. And I'll send you this presentation, by the way.

[19:30:03 - 19:30:03] Jeffrey Cohen: oh, that'd be

[19:30:04 - 19:31:03] Scott Davidson: And then $11 per month for workflow automation. So that's just kind of the backend sending things around and routing and then the kind of the brain of the operations is this data enrichment platform. So this is where give me one second. Sorry. So this is kind of the thing that would connect everything, so it would, it would take the list in enrich the data, verify the emails, write the AI, copy, etc, etc. And then push it into the LinkedIn tool or the email tool or wherever we want. So this is kind of the brains of the operation. And there is a cheaper plan, but this is the plan that allows you to Use, We can use our own chat tpt instance, which is way way cheaper because they

[19:30:54 - 19:30:55] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:30:55 - 19:31:06] Scott Davidson: charge their credit rate is seven cents per credit and openai. You know, a simple task is like A fraction of a penny, so it's substantially cheaper.

[19:31:06 - 19:31:08] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:31:07 - 19:31:15] Scott Davidson: So yeah. So here's the total cost. It's something around for well depending on how many LinkedIn accounts you have of course, but around $500,

[19:31:13 - 19:31:24] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah. I'm thinking we would use a minimum of the three LinkedIn accounts for the three partners, potentially one for our marketer. Um, I guess.

[19:31:20 - 19:31:24] Scott Davidson: Okay. Okay.

[19:31:26 - 19:31:41] Jeffrey Cohen: Two thoughts that I have based on just this to start. And I don't know if if you

[19:31:29 - 19:31:30] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:31:31 - 19:31:45] Jeffrey Cohen: even have a say, an idea on this regarding the LinkedIn monthly cost is that. Also in addition to Is LinkedIn premium worth it on something like this.

[19:31:47 - 19:31:55] Scott Davidson: Oh, that's a good question. I haven't thought about that. I Don't think so.

[19:31:54 - 19:32:09] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, because I was gonna say, currently our marketer, we're paying for her to do LinkedIn, premium, and I don't know that we're actually getting anything out of it, and I'm wondering if that cost would be better. Spent on our partners

[19:32:05 - 19:32:13] Scott Davidson: Probably.

[19:32:05 - 19:32:09] Jeffrey Cohen: being LinkedIn, premium members.

[19:32:13 - 19:32:25] Scott Davidson: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think it's necessary. I mean, you can send something called an inmail and then you see who looks at your profile, but these other tools like

[19:32:18 - 19:32:20] Jeffrey Cohen: They do that, too.

[19:32:18 - 19:32:25] Scott Davidson: Triggerify that I mentioned, which is separate than this. It tells you who's looking at your profile.

[19:32:21 - 19:32:25] Jeffrey Cohen: Oh okay. Then that's basically what we would be getting from it, okay?

[19:32:25 - 19:32:32] Scott Davidson: Yeah, so I don't, I don't think you need premium. I'll double check that, but

[19:32:30 - 19:32:31] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:32:30 - 19:32:32] Scott Davidson: I'm fairly positive. You don't need premium to be able to do that.

[19:32:32 - 19:32:59] Jeffrey Cohen: Google. um and then I guess my other follow-up is one of the things that that the other gentleman that was in the thread on Reddit had mentioned to me is And I think this is where his cost kind of added up to more and it was the

[19:32:45 - 19:32:45] Scott Davidson: So yeah. Yeah.

[19:32:48 - 19:32:59] Jeffrey Cohen: advertising on LinkedIn. He was talking about, like, lead magnets, drip campaigns videos, I'm assuming that would be separate from this kind of thing.

[19:32:57 - 19:33:14] Scott Davidson: That is separate. I Don't do advertising. I'm not, I'm not gonna offer that service because I'm not

[19:33:02 - 19:33:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:33:04 - 19:33:14] Scott Davidson: familiar with it enough. That's something I'm gonna start looking into and and

[19:33:06 - 19:33:07] Jeffrey Cohen: That that's okay.

[19:33:09 - 19:33:14] Scott Davidson: maybe working with like a partner or third party in the future, you know, you

[19:33:11 - 19:33:13] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:33:12 - 19:33:22] Scott Davidson: can I can assist with like the high level strategy and we can figure out like how to build lead magnets and now these days with like AI and things, it's pretty

[19:33:21 - 19:33:26] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:33:23 - 19:33:35] Scott Davidson: straightforward and relatively easy to implement so we can maybe we incorporate that as kind of like phase Two or because I think you could get pretty far with

[19:33:31 - 19:33:32] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:33:34 - 19:33:35] Scott Davidson: just saying, you know

[19:33:35 - 19:33:38] Jeffrey Cohen: The direct messaging kind of thing.

[19:33:38 - 19:33:44] Scott Davidson: Yeah, like hey XYZ like we did this for a similar oil and gas company like if we could do something for similar for you would that be of interest?

[19:33:45 - 19:33:45] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:33:45 - 19:33:53] Scott Davidson: I think you're gonna get a high level of interest there to start, and then doing

[19:33:47 - 19:33:49] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:33:49 - 19:34:06] Scott Davidson: a nurture. Yeah, nurture, drip campaign, sort of things, I think really. Help you squeeze out that next 10% or something but you know, we're going from

[19:33:57 - 19:34:07] Jeffrey Cohen: That makes sense to me, okay?

[19:33:58 - 19:34:11] Scott Davidson: zero to I'd rather go or I'd rather go from 0 to 70 than from 70 to 90 to start. So it's kind of like crawl walk run but it's up to you. Yeah. Any other questions?

[19:34:09 - 19:34:16] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, cool. Um, so far, that's it based on the stuff that you have put up, that's great.

[19:34:14 - 19:34:35] Scott Davidson: Okay, cool. And then these are my costs. So phase one would be documentation on the lower side of of that range. You mentioned 4k a month. I like to do a three-month

[19:34:23 - 19:34:23] Jeffrey Cohen: Mm-hmm.

[19:34:27 - 19:34:55] Scott Davidson: minimum just because the first month were kind of setting things up or getting things started and I think you really need three months to get a sense of How things are going and start to see results and iterate on the messaging. And then even before that, it's 30 days, you can just tell me we're done. And that's fine. And we don't need to continue on beyond that and you can talk, You know, I

[19:34:46 - 19:34:47] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:34:49 - 19:35:17] Scott Davidson: know it's a busy season, so if you wanted to pause and pick back up in the future, you know, that's something we could do too. Um, and yeah, so it would include kind of everything we talked about the bi-weekly strategy review calls, we would optimize the copy, all the research, 10K research, things LinkedIn, and our email outreach setup and campaign management. And the initial sprint.

[19:35:17 - 19:35:36] Jeffrey Cohen: No. So I mean that looks like like you have kind of listed out there face one

[19:35:19 - 19:35:21] Scott Davidson: Any questions on that?

[19:35:25 - 19:35:36] Jeffrey Cohen: about 12,000 4k a month, plus that approximately 5 to 600 dollars a month for the the stuff going into it. Yeah. Okay.

[19:35:34 - 19:35:57] Scott Davidson: Then, yeah. And and the reason it's better for you to have the infrastructure is, a lot of people will charge up charge you there. They'll pay for it and up, charge you, and then too, if you decide you don't like me and you want to keep

[19:35:44 - 19:35:44] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:35:46 - 19:35:57] Scott Davidson: it, it's a nightmare. So it just makes it easier for you to own it and you can

[19:35:48 - 19:35:48] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:35:53 - 19:35:57] Scott Davidson: manage. You know, if you want cancel the service and you don't like it, it's much easier and they're all month to month.

[19:35:58 - 19:36:11] Jeffrey Cohen: and then I guess where you have listed, sorry where you have listed Phase Two

[19:35:58 - 19:36:00] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Draw.

[19:36:02 - 19:36:11] Jeffrey Cohen: Scott, the 2000 for the one time for setting up and the 5500 a month is the 5500

[19:36:03 - 19:36:04] Scott Davidson: Yes.

[19:36:08 - 19:36:11] Jeffrey Cohen: a month for the software subscriptions, basically,

[19:36:11 - 19:36:26] Scott Davidson: No, we would replace this cost with this cost and the reason is because we're going to do. The workflow configuration one will have ongoing workflow configuration. So we can say we want to add

[19:36:23 - 19:36:25] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:36:26 - 19:36:42] Scott Davidson: Two per month. What will come up with number per month that we can add? And then then those have more maintenance costs because they could break like if open AI comes out with the new model and we want to update it or we want to just change

[19:36:36 - 19:36:37] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:36:39 - 19:36:49] Scott Davidson: the messaging on an ongoing basis etc. At the social listening like you know, all these iterative at the League campaigns like that would all be included. And we would just

[19:36:49 - 19:36:50] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:36:49 - 19:36:54] Scott Davidson: Take up one month, you know? Item by item and add those in as we go.

[19:36:54 - 19:36:55] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:36:55 - 19:37:07] Scott Davidson: um, And then yeah, this, I kind of mentioned briefly but Implementing like a. Sales process. So, bant and medic are too. Have you heard of mantra medic before?

[19:37:07 - 19:37:09] Jeffrey Cohen: I have not actually.

[19:37:08 - 19:37:28] Scott Davidson: Okay, so those are good ways to help with qualification. So, Bantas budget authority, need and timing. So when you qualify on that first meeting, you want to understand those things so that you can qualify our disqualify like it, it's

[19:37:21 - 19:37:23] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:37:25 - 19:37:38] Scott Davidson: timing sorry. Like if that person doesn't have authority, You kind of want to figure out who does and give them in the conversation.

[19:37:33 - 19:37:33] Jeffrey Cohen: Yes, exactly.

[19:37:33 - 19:37:38] Scott Davidson: What's their budget of course? How how much of a need is it?

[19:37:34 - 19:37:46] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, and if they're Yeah, and then I guess like you said timing. So if they're, if they're under contract with somebody for the next six months, okay, all up after that, etc.

[19:37:43 - 19:37:51] Scott Davidson: Right. Exactly. Exactly, exactly. So we would add them to a campaign and then medic, I can never remember what it stands for but it's basically the exact same thing. It's like,

[19:37:51 - 19:37:52] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:37:52 - 19:38:02] Scott Davidson: Yes, for champion. So who's the person? That'll push it forward. Diaz like decision maker. I is the investment timeline or, you know, something like that. They're basically the same thing.

[19:38:03 - 19:38:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:38:04 - 19:38:30] Scott Davidson: so, that would be That would be, I would recommend having some sort of, like, exit criteria, so, You know, we would set staging. And what I've seen in the past is, you know, we book you book a meeting in stage one stage, you progress it to stage two, if you're able to Confirm that these things are true.

[19:38:29 - 19:38:30] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:38:31 - 19:39:16] Scott Davidson: and then after that it's you know, proposal negotiation and closed one And then the CRM costs. Again I there's one called Ateo which is very popular and new these days and it has some of the workflow configuration involved or in it. So I haven't gotten deep enough to know if we wouldn't need the $11 a month. Make tool yet. But that one's I think twenty dollars per seat per month, maybe 25. And then AI usage. I mean if you're hitting $50 like we're going crazy, so I would highly doubt it's gonna be $50 a month. And then I mentioned here, like you won't need zoom info anymore. After so by

[19:39:15 - 19:39:22] Jeffrey Cohen: That was, that was going to be my follow-up. Question is. Yeah, so that that

[19:39:15 - 19:39:16] Scott Davidson: the

[19:39:19 - 19:39:22] Jeffrey Cohen: would take the place I guess of the zoom info.

[19:39:22 - 19:39:32] Scott Davidson: Yeah, yes. So these tool the tool that I reference here is called clay and Clay

[19:39:23 - 19:39:30] Jeffrey Cohen: We're paying. Yeah.

[19:39:30 - 19:39:41] Scott Davidson: has native Integrations with zoom info, and a bunch of other data providers that do all sorts of different things in competitive, zoom info. So we you could just pay

[19:39:39 - 19:39:40] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:39:42 - 19:39:56] Scott Davidson: per credit and that way, you know you don't have to subscribe to a platform. The platform is Is this and all your a lot of the money goes towards the credit usage. Anyways so you know, it'd be I suspect substantially cheaper.

[19:39:56 - 19:39:57] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:39:57 - 19:39:58] Scott Davidson: Zoom info.

[19:40:00 - 19:40:02] Jeffrey Cohen: Perfect.

[19:40:01 - 19:40:04] Scott Davidson: Um yeah, any other questions on this part?

[19:40:05 - 19:40:14] Jeffrey Cohen: Not that I can think of. I think of sorry I'm not great at holding my questions

[19:40:07 - 19:40:08] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:40:10 - 19:40:14] Jeffrey Cohen: to the end. So if it's fitting that as we go,

[19:40:11 - 19:40:15] Scott Davidson: Yeah. No. No. Yeah, I'll go for it.

[19:40:14 - 19:40:15] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:40:15 - 19:40:20] Scott Davidson: Okay, any any concerns any? Surprises.

[19:40:20 - 19:40:55] Jeffrey Cohen: No, I mean based on the the other call that I had the numbers. Don't surprise me. and I think the, the information, In in Phase Two. I was just kind of confused at first is kind of how I said, it's that 5,500 a month for the the software but you'd mentioned that that's kind of like Yeah. Just the ongoing maintenance, the review of the workbook and fluttering workflow configuration the changing those up that starts to make sense a little bit more to me.

[19:40:55 - 19:41:08] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Okay, that's good. And then yeah, we can. If we want to start passing off things and you know, maybe reduce this we can do, I can build sows and videos and however you want to do it and you know, we can pass it off.

[19:41:09 - 19:41:10] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:41:10 - 19:41:37] Scott Davidson: all right, and then Just explaining, you know. Why? This is a good approach. That modern AI, leverage. Actually, I was f****** send you the report, but I was just reading a report that A venture capital company, did that? their companies that are fully leveraging AI in their sales processes are Their reps are hitting 5%, higher quota attainment.

[19:41:37 - 19:41:39] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:41:38 - 19:41:48] Scott Davidson: And then it has all the conversion rates. From those, the stages I talked about For the most part, they're substantially higher when you're leveraging AI.

[19:41:48 - 19:41:49] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:41:50 - 19:41:59] Scott Davidson: I know we talked about early next week, so I think that aligns but, you know, all Leave it to you. You think it's um, you

[19:41:56 - 19:42:08] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah. That would because with them on the Sixth seventh and then we could get back together on the 10th. Okay.

[19:42:05 - 19:42:20] Scott Davidson: Okay. Okay. That's good. Yeah. I definitely recommend. Yeah, it's just so we can get kind of kicking as soon as possible. I mean the Linkedin's will go out like

[19:42:12 - 19:42:14] Jeffrey Cohen: Absolutely.

[19:42:15 - 19:42:22] Scott Davidson: within. We need to create the list and optimize the messaging first so that I'll take a couple days. But after that, I mean, It's very quick for getting.

[19:42:22 - 19:42:24] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, cool.

[19:42:23 - 19:42:34] Scott Davidson: The initial campaign now. So let me stop sharing. This one. Let's see if I had any other questions. Do you have any other questions for me?

[19:42:34 - 19:42:38] Jeffrey Cohen: Um, not that I can think of that's been pretty thorough.

[19:42:37 - 19:42:49] Scott Davidson: Okay. Sounds good. And then, you know, are there anything that gives you like pause about moving forward? Is it really just reviewing with the partners or or anything else on your mind?

[19:42:48 - 19:43:17] Jeffrey Cohen: For most part, it's just yeah getting getting Jen and James in room and sitting down with that and talking about it. They like I said they don't leave until their flight is If I look, It's it 11:00 tomorrow. I know I have a two o'clock conference call. Today. But other than that, if you could send that over, I might even be able to

[19:43:13 - 19:43:14] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:43:13 - 19:43:17] Jeffrey Cohen: get with them today and then see.

[19:43:15 - 19:43:24] Scott Davidson: That works.

[19:43:18 - 19:43:30] Jeffrey Cohen: If we can start talking about it so we can get together before Friday, and that might be able to be things up. Yeah, I can't think of anything else off the top of my head Scott.

[19:43:30 - 19:43:39] Scott Davidson: Okay, awesome. Yeah, I will send you that over. Let me know if any other questions come up in the meantime. And

[19:43:37 - 19:44:02] Jeffrey Cohen: Sure. Like my first initial thought is that. Yeah, once the two of our once the three of us talk about it, I'm assuming we might want to do like a group conference call where it will all sit in the conference room and we'll get together and we'll give you a call and kind of talk through it and see what we think going

[19:43:50 - 19:43:51] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:43:53 - 19:44:03] Jeffrey Cohen: forward. But I I like what I'm hearing, I think it's something that we need to do and Yeah.

[19:44:04 - 19:44:05] Scott Davidson: That's great. Yeah.

[19:44:04 - 19:44:06] Jeffrey Cohen: I'm okay.

[19:44:05 - 19:44:18] Scott Davidson: Yeah, I think I think it'll be good. I think, you know. Within three, three months for sure. I think you'll start to see things rolling. I suspect, it'll happen quicker than that with LinkedIn, especially

[19:44:17 - 19:44:17] Jeffrey Cohen: Mmm.

[19:44:18 - 19:44:32] Scott Davidson: It's you know you guys have been around like you have you've done this before like you know you're doing you have results. So like that makes it substantially easier when you have, you know, I've worked with like pre-market fit this

[19:44:29 - 19:44:30] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:44:29 - 19:44:32] Scott Davidson: software companies. Like We don't even know yourself. It's like okay.

[19:44:32 - 19:45:00] Jeffrey Cohen: no, and that's like you said that's the good thing is I think we since we have been doing it for a while, we have the history that we can lean on of Of wins and and the ability to show people what we've done. I know one of the

[19:44:44 - 19:44:45] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:44:50 - 19:45:00] Jeffrey Cohen: concerns that James always has is using specific client names but I don't see any reason that we couldn't talk about some of this stuff in generalized terms and give that information out. Yeah.

[19:44:58 - 19:45:05] Scott Davidson: Yeah. You can say, we helped another company, another large, whatever Fortune 500 company to XYZ.

[19:45:05 - 19:46:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Exactly. And and I know like you said, I think one of the things that you had mentioned on, there was the tool that reads Kind of what other competitors are doing and so you can, you can play stuff. I've seen some of that on LinkedIn and we've talked about it just between the three of us. I mean I saw Another firm that posted something recently of like a new client that they had, that had two billion dollars in assets. And in the first year they saved Two million dollars in tax and I'm like, okay, that one percent return on the assets and I'm like we have a client that we've been working for five years. I took it over this year and they have 500 million dollars in assets. So they have a quarter of the assets and I saved them, 200 million or 200. Yeah, 200 million dollars. In tax. So off a quarter of the assets, I saved them. What was it like

[19:46:04 - 19:46:05] Scott Davidson: A hundred X.

[19:46:04 - 19:46:08] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, a hundred X. So yeah, that I'm going.

[19:46:06 - 19:46:10] Scott Davidson: Oh my God, yeah, that's a perfect case study right there. There we go.

[19:46:09 - 19:46:12] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, that doesn't seem like a good way to look at it.

[19:46:11 - 19:46:34] Scott Davidson: Yeah, yeah. No, that's awesome. And then Yeah, I think another thing to think about, you know, I'm not, of course, This is aware of the competitive landscape, but thinking about like Yeah how you all are different. Like we go on site, we

[19:46:19 - 19:46:20] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah.

[19:46:23 - 19:46:34] Scott Davidson: we are much more thorough, you know, whatever it is. That's a good way to handle

[19:46:24 - 19:46:26] Jeffrey Cohen: Yes.

[19:46:27 - 19:46:34] Scott Davidson: things to you can do like competitive takeout campaigns, we can do that. The case study, I think it will be good.

[19:46:34 - 19:46:45] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah, and there's definitely a couple of those that I think we can point to in different industries and refining and pulp and paper and oil and gas and chemical. I think we can hit all of those kind of

[19:46:42 - 19:46:46] Scott Davidson: Okay. Okay.

[19:46:45 - 19:46:47] Jeffrey Cohen: Show what we've done.

[19:46:47 - 19:46:56] Scott Davidson: Awesome. Yeah, that sounds great. No, I'm excited. I mean I love doing this stuff so it's exciting to me. But yeah, I will.

[19:46:53 - 19:47:00] Jeffrey Cohen: Yeah. it's It's not my real house but I need to get more involved in it too.

[19:46:59 - 19:47:04] Scott Davidson: Yeah, I mean, you know, sales is the life blood. So

[19:47:03 - 19:47:04] Jeffrey Cohen: Yep.

[19:47:04 - 19:47:21] Scott Davidson: Doing the messaging in the top of funnel at all. It'll all Be the first area. Focus will be top of funnel and then focusing on conversion,

[19:47:12 - 19:47:13] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay.

[19:47:12 - 19:47:21] Scott Davidson: like, later down the line, but just qualifying them and things like that up, front should help with the downstream conversion as well. So, yeah,

[19:47:19 - 19:47:20] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, perfect.

[19:47:21 - 19:47:32] Scott Davidson: I will send you this and yeah, let me know if any questions come up and yeah to the extent. You're able to talk about it with them today and want to meet with me tomorrow. Just let me know and I can move things around and make it work.

[19:47:32 - 19:47:34] Jeffrey Cohen: Okay, great. I appreciate it.

[19:47:33 - 19:47:36] Scott Davidson: So okay, awesome. Thank you. Jeffrey.
