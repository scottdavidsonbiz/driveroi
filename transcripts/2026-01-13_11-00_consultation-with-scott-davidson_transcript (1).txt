[19:00:01 - 19:00:02] Scott Davidson: I'm doing well, are you?

[19:00:02 - 19:00:04] Matt Crawford: I'm doing. All right. Thanks for being with me.

[19:00:08 - 19:00:11] Scott Davidson: co-founder of drive Roi. Yeah, thank you for taking the time. I've got a Brenda here as well. She's my

[19:00:10 - 19:00:17] Matt Crawford: Oh, I'm push to the wrong way. I guess maybe I'm not centered. Okay, there we go.

[19:00:17 - 19:00:19] Scott Davidson: Good, where are you located?

[19:00:18 - 19:00:18] Brenda Hali: Yes.

[19:00:18 - 19:00:22] Matt Crawford: So we're out of North Carolina, as our headquarters. We're a

[19:00:22 - 19:00:22] Scott Davidson: Oh cool.

[19:00:29 - 19:00:33] Matt Crawford: field services company, essentially bridging, the gap between remote teams and I won't say global but we're working on Global, We're a national A nationwide physical locations,

[19:00:32 - 19:00:39] Scott Davidson: Right. Right. Yeah, I saw that. We did some research, obviously.

[19:00:48 - 19:00:53] Matt Crawford: couple questions if you don't mind. So we've done internal.

[19:00:48 - 19:00:48] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:00:49 - 19:01:43] Matt Crawford: transparent. So I'll give you a bit of a background and that I wanted to ask a I want to say so you're the one that you sent me, so I'll just completely Like, internal SDRs and email marketing. And then we've hired a third party that did email marketing for us. Both of which left a lot of desirability for, you know, what we're doing. And then we had issues on our team and and you know, replacing people and then we're like screwed. And then we had our third party team that was started out somewhat promising and there's oh, we got to do this. And, you know, I understand like we've got a tweak it and kind of like find the right, the right rhythm, but it went from like decent to worst to like terrible. And I feel like I let some of my team in to give some direction and get, you know, I was okay. I don't have time to work on this project. Let me, you know,

[19:01:37 - 19:01:37] Scott Davidson: 

[19:01:39 - 19:02:25] Matt Crawford: allocate this to you, you work on this. We've got these guys, I'll give them, give them what we need. And like, I said it was producing and then I wanted to just absolutely like really terrible. And so we canceled, I've canceled all that. I've got rid of some SDRs, I've got it down to where I've got one, account executive, such SDR like and then he's American. And I've got two other

[19:02:20 - 19:02:21] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:02:22 - 19:04:08] Matt Crawford: foreign like they're from the Philippines, they're in sales and they do a plethora of things like marketing. I know our website is terrible. I know our LinkedIn profiles are For instance, they're just like, just sales in general, they'll do quotes, whereas needed. So, that's a bit of background on our failed attempts for They'll do outreach. They'll do nothing with email marketing, though. Nothing with content creation. They're just really just, you know, there to help out And now, our email campaigns are non-existent. So we're not doing a ton in terrible. sales, but that was kind of my, I understand where painful. But, you know, I've done it before, like, in our dispatched apartment ripped it out, built it back up and now it's like, amazing. So that's kind of ripped everything out like, Hey, it's not working. Let's just start fresh with like things won't working and just ripped it out, put it built to back up, where we're at, right? We're at our second or third go, I don't know. However, you want to count it but we're looking for a strategic partner. Help us. And I understand that aces in their places, right? So maybe, like, to help us in general with a ton of our marketing because if you email market is it to come into and you got to have the follow-up and the sequences and so it's it's huge. The whole whole funnel. Right. There is huge and like I just him I great, but you got to have the website and then you got to have the the CRM for won't say I'm lost I kind of know what I want but I have to be realistic on a email marketing is where you guys are. But ultimately, I'm looking for someone what we can afford and then just like how do we start getting leads coming in and so I think email marketing is But as I said before, everything else kind of plays a significant part in kind Um, by far the most effective in the in the kind of the vertical that we're in. of that trust factor, right? You gotta have the website, the LinkedIn and all that kind of stuff goes together. So, I'm interested to see because based on what you shot back to me and I want to make sure that I'm thinking, you guys shot me back. Like, Scott, did you send me the email or who sent? Okay, so let me just look at my

[19:04:04 - 19:04:05] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:04:07 - 19:04:08] Matt Crawford: email right quick.

[19:04:08 - 19:04:13] Scott Davidson: it might have been from one of the sending accounts, so you may not it may be

[19:04:13 - 19:04:13] Matt Crawford: Yeah.

[19:04:14 - 19:04:15] Scott Davidson: Let me see those.

[19:04:14 - 19:04:15] Matt Crawford: It was probably.

[19:04:16 - 19:04:20] Scott Davidson: It was from. Steven.

[19:04:21 - 19:04:25] Matt Crawford: It's Steven. Okay. Yeah, so I mean, I get all that I we did we have done the

[19:04:21 - 19:04:22] Scott Davidson: Had to be.

[19:04:24 - 19:04:32] Matt Crawford: same thing. Steven, was it for the bdr hiring, or what was it, okay.

[19:04:31 - 19:04:34] Scott Davidson: Yes. There should have been a list 25 target accounts in there.

[19:04:33 - 19:04:55] Matt Crawford: Yep. That's yeah. So in bdr like hiring is like one of our like it's not even our it's not even like our big vertical right like so we're not we are a staff augmentation company to some degree but our claim to fame is like break fix field service work. That's where we make the majority of our revenue and not to

[19:04:52 - 19:04:52] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:04:54 - 19:05:08] Matt Crawford: say that we don't want to get into that. Because we do have several accounts that we do provide some staff augmentation for obviously that's something that I'd like to get more involved in but we do have like a dispatch department and essentially what they do is they feel or

[19:05:07 - 19:05:32] Scott Davidson: Yep.

[19:05:08 - 19:05:58] Matt Crawford: they they handle field service requests. So we have a client. Someone request working with the remote, like engineer like systems engineer. Something else. So troubleshooting, physical equipment, like opening a new location, but I think comes in, we schedule for a technician to go on site and they generally are that doing things on PREM, whether it's installing, physical equipment, you hit like all that stuff. Yeah essentially did. Which kind of was what grabbed my attention. So it seemed like you you had a bit of an understanding of kind of what we did the targets that you provided were within our ICP. So they've got, you know, X amount of locations, X amount of employees, and you just kind of you kind of understood. So I feel like, maybe you're already a step ahead. And if we provided some additional guidance, you could probably be really effective was kind of what I ascertained from all that.

[19:06:03 - 19:07:19] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah, appreciate that. Yeah, I think that was all super helpful context. I definitely have a handful of questions, but just by way of, you know, our background. So both Brenda and I have worked in B2B software for Ever and in revenue operations and in go-to-market operations and finance. Etc. So um implementation and opera operationalizing, everything and then determining. We have a lot of experience doing like kind of what you're saying with like CRM allocate like, in my perspective, I even look at it from like a dollar based on metrics, like what's working and not working and where we need to perspective, like what's giving us Sroi, Which is what we're called driveroi. So, That's just one component of it that I think. things like attribution where we can say? Yes, they looked at your LinkedIn page You know, it's helpful like we can we do like Brenda's really good at doing and that Was, you know, part of the customer journey that they took to end up, you know, working with you. I think, I don't know Brenda if you want to give any like additional context or background but I kind of explains at a high level our background. And then, Yeah, I mean this

[19:07:16 - 19:07:32] Matt Crawford: Yeah.

[19:07:17 - 19:07:47] Scott Davidson: just for a little bit of context, This was a once if we were to get in there look at your CRM we'd like to We want to go strategy first, you know Who's your ICP? What a good clothes one deals. Look like Why are you losing deals? Etc. And then we refine our tactics based on our Type of AI workflow that I've like built out to do this ICP and this is just based on publicly information publicly available information. So yes of course,

[19:07:45 - 19:07:46] Matt Crawford: Mm-hmm.

[19:07:46 - 19:08:18] Scott Davidson: findings and strategy. And refined over time like it's not a set in forget thing, right? Like this is a moving target. so, At a high level. That's Our approach. I definitely have a couple of questions in terms of, Do you staff the field service? Personnel globally. And they like let's say you have a project in Washington State or something. Do you have employees in Washington State or do you subcontract those?

[19:08:16 - 19:08:42] Matt Crawford: So yeah, we subcontract most everything. So that's kind of how we get our, that's how we get our presence. So we've got a, we've got a staff of about, like, 15, right of our W-2, or some of those are even contractors, but they're full-time employees or full-time, team members, right? And then we all of our field personal our primarily are contractors. And so, like, we could essentially

[19:08:44 - 19:08:46] Scott Davidson: As in.

[19:08:54 - 19:09:47] Matt Crawford: those those. So they're scalability is is crazy right? One customer one, right customer could set us like on a trajectory. That would be like, you know, like be in like, all 50 states at the same time, right? And we just are managing get on the get on the Bronco and just hold on, right? So Um like our and we have a bunch of different like areas so channel, right? So might be like an MSP or a manufacturer or like an integrator that needs. You know what we find is. A lot of them are regional and then they come upon a like, hey like we want to put cameras at all of our location that can you help customer that has, you know, they're dealing with the headquarters and then us? And they're like, And so that's where we would come in and we would help manage that project tools and so, like, I can myself and my project teams, we can spec out of deploy that project like We know how to we. Just we're really good with remote basically, do you information. But if you give somebody on site a camera, there are those occasions where we need to send somebody on site to get, project a lot of times remotely without having to send anybody on site. Now,

[19:09:52 - 19:09:52] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:09:52 - 19:09:59] Matt Crawford: and I can generally get everything that I need to provide a quote to do whatever And we're in a Google meet I can record that and tell you what, I want to see the installation may be. At that particular site. So

[19:09:57 - 19:09:57] Scott Davidson: Got it.

[19:10:12 - 19:10:30] Matt Crawford: We provide a really good service. And then, of course, we have resources all over and, you know, we've vet our sources really well, there's a lot of people, we're the only ones doing it. It is somewhat competitive. I won't say a lot, but there are people in this space, right? It's not like But yeah. So channel is one. And then we have our direct which would be like, for instance, like a like a petco right, they may have their own internal it team, right? So a nation a nationwide company and they've got to help desk and

[19:10:27 - 19:10:28] Scott Davidson: Not.

[19:10:38 - 19:10:52] Matt Crawford: gets a technician out on site that then can work with their remote team to you everything else of that and they just don't have anybody on site. So they're dealing with either contractors or they're dealing with a company like ours that know, isolate whatever issue it isn't resolve it. Um, Obviously the channel is, you know, good but it's not probably as profitable as, you know, a direct client because we can charge more per hour.

[19:10:58 - 19:11:02] Scott Davidson: like 90 10, you know, percentages is it like 90% field services

[19:11:01 - 19:11:29] Matt Crawford: Yes, I would say 90% now that's something that we really do want to get into it. It kind of bodes well with what we already do. So essentially we're providing have a company, that's open up a new location, right? And they want somebody on people, right? And so if we're already providing the on-prem support, you may site for the first 30 days, 60 days, just to kind of like, help everybody, you know, get things done, they want the on-premes but they're not gonna have a full-time it person there, it's all gonna be done remote and then

[19:11:28 - 19:11:29] Scott Davidson: Yep.

[19:11:50 - 19:12:09] Matt Crawford: a big market for that. What we're doing right now for our staff, Augmentation is We would still augment that like on a case-by-case scenario. Like, if they had whatever. The certain, we're not doing any of that right now, but I know there's an issue, we would then be dispatched out on an hourly rate versus like, Hey, we'll have a contract for the first 30 days. We'll have somebody there from 8 am to 5 pm Monday, through Friday or we'll have five people there, you know, with one particular MSP. Which they'll just have us outsource. So, they're doing, they're doing that where they have a client that wants to have somebody full-time on on, you know,

[19:12:22 - 19:12:23] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:12:26 - 19:12:32] Matt Crawford: full-time on-prem, right? And so, they've got the contract. They're outsourcing to go as direct as possible into into an arrangement like that to where we're then they're, you know, they're working at one of their client locations. It's like, it's kind of like three hands in the pot, right. So we're obviously trying it to us to find the personnel, and then we're providing them the personnel and doing staff augmentation. I don't, I won't, I won't lie. I don't understand that.

[19:12:45 - 19:12:45] Scott Davidson: 

[19:12:46 - 19:14:08] Matt Crawford: when somebody understands that story like yourself and our ICP, like it kind of they're pain points are we understand, it's difficult to tell that story. So Market, as much as I understand the brake fixed market, like I think we cracked the brake fix open. We understand what the customers want, we understand where gets my attention because We're not support, we're the field services. We will be on site to do what you need to do, but we're gonna generally need to work with somebody that has access to the systems to guide us or to give us, you know, checks and balances like, service department, you know, it departments that have 300 or more locations or generally have some type of support So MSPs are great. That don't have a field 50 More locations are great. Because Okay, yeah, we can see it or Hey, no, that's not working, right? We've got to talked to somebody today or yesterday they've got like 350 locations and they're You know, they have a remote staff and instead of sending somebody like I just like sending their whole staff like 30 people because they just had an acquisition of this new client, right? So they're sending everybody out to onboard this client. I'm like, Why don't you just send us? I think you're only gonna pay us full over there. We're gonna use local technicians ship all the equipment out. You want to installed And they're like, Oh wow, that I didn't think about that. Like, the amount of right to do, what needs to be done? It's a no-brainer. So most most companies

[19:14:04 - 19:14:04] Scott Davidson: All right.

[19:14:05 - 19:14:20] Matt Crawford: they're doing. Because now, they're, they're whole department is just strain for like an entire week. And then they come back and play back up where they could money that we save somebody and then the resources, they can stay doing what just use our services, we'll get on site. We'll work with them from their desk, have figured that out. contractor or something else of that, but some customers are still, you know, buying tickets and paying for hotel rooms to send people out to do stuff. Through a competitor, you know, there's something of it, you know, using a

[19:14:21 - 19:14:32] Scott Davidson: Imagine. Okay. And then, you know, you mentioned that you work with an outbound partner in the past. Was there something that caused the performance to decrease or, you know, what were you able to kind of get a sense of what it was?

[19:14:41 - 19:15:20] Matt Crawford: It is they just didn't understand our our ICP and we explained it, I have it in leads is what it boils down to. So we are paying them x amount of dollars per month and there is no like there's no writing it's 50 more locations. Like I think they weren't purchasing the right They were supposed to be getting us like 20 appointments for a month, which we probably stayed with it. But we want from like one to two. So like zero to one. that got one, right? And like I understood like, hey, like it's a process like, And I mean the one the account that I'm doing now, that's 350 locations. That even, if we're getting like one and then two, then five and then ten, like, I came from that email sequence. And so I can't say that we didn't get anything. you know, I'll give you three or four months to, so I can see someone even if could see some type of trajectory, go on the right direction, then I would

[19:15:19 - 19:15:20] Scott Davidson: 

[19:15:20 - 19:15:47] Matt Crawford: always, certainly didn't get What we were promised, right? And I just felt like we were doing it kind of half but so I really wanted to get with a partner that AI can trust and b we can scale with they, they just, you know, They weren't working. I mean, we we were, we have 50 domains, I think that we

[19:15:42 - 19:15:43] Scott Davidson: oh,

[19:15:43 - 19:15:47] Matt Crawford: purchased through them. So, just like you were doing, you were using a different

[19:15:46 - 19:15:55] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Hmm.

[19:15:56 - 19:16:14] Matt Crawford: her account just to keep. I mean, so we had like the right metrics going on. that we were using the email. We weren't sending more than 15 emails a day per domain. And then, and then we had two email, dude, two Gmail accounts per domain We had the right system, we were using like sale. Was it like Lee sales lead AI, or like was it lead? Uh, smart lead is what the system that they were using, and they had it all

[19:16:13 - 19:16:13] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:16:26 - 19:18:02] Matt Crawford: different campaigns going on and we just weren't getting the traction. So like the foundation was great. And so as I okay, is it the content? And I don't think it was the content but maybe it was I'm not a content writer but we we play with different content, was it? built out and they would let us see certain things. So we had a bunch of The the system like was it a deliverability? I don't think it was that or was it the list that you were getting that that you are marketing to? And I believe it was that because that's where the dollar comes in. Like wherever you're buying your list from or you're ever, you're getting that you're list from. I feel is the variable and the cheaper, they go the more profit they make so they were probably trying to buy the cheapest leads possible and it was coming in. And so quality leader, This isn't gonna work, and we never had really inside into that. transparent. Like I think you're buying cheap leads, You need to be buying So they're like, all right, we're gonna start scraping Google. then there and then I was like, I was telling them, I was like, Hey, I'm very And I'm like, okay, like you're the, you're the email marketing. Experts, like I'm relying on you to get these from the best places possible. So then we were getting like, one site locations that like. So they weren't meeting our ICP. And like, and my team was so eager to take stuff like that. They don't meet our ICP. so, we were spending a bunch of time, like qualifying, these clients, and I'm Like, so wasting your time they're gonna deal with a local vendor and then like, Oh well we got one. That's got 10 location. Years. Like, Yeah, they're all in Seattle. Again, not our ICP because they can use a local vendor to do it Our, Our core value comes in, when you've got, you know, a bunch of locations, spread it over geographic location, where you've got to use multiple vendors, where we come in as your single point of contact your

[19:17:48 - 19:17:53] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Mmm.

[19:18:08 - 19:18:13] Matt Crawford: vendor. We handle everything when we find the right client, It's really like a no-brainer. They love our services. Our pricing is consistent with what you would pay a local vendor. And so, it just makes sense to deal with one person to though. I mean, it's a trust thing. We, you know, they want to try us out, you know, they got to kind of get out of what they were doing, you know, dotted out to handle everything. It's not really a back and forth. It is a long process,

[19:18:12 - 19:18:13] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Yeah.

[19:18:13 - 19:18:13] Matt Crawford: at all. So

[19:18:13 - 19:18:28] Scott Davidson: Um okay so a couple questions on that. Kind of you just were getting at it. But what is like the average sales cycle? Look at look like in terms of I guess time and you know, maybe number of steps things like that and then average order value

[19:18:30 - 19:19:11] Matt Crawford: um, so my experience is It is a slow spigot that once you got to get it to start dripping first. And once that once it drips, and you get a couple, get a couple service tickets and what I'm told from my, from my existing customers is, Matt, you amazing. Okay. getting these updates like they, you got to experience our service because we don't do anything really special. We coordinating people on site. But what I, like, Oh, wow, like this was easy. Oh, wow, these guys are great. Wow, we're Well, what are we doing? Amazing? And they're like, we could updates of like we get the text name and the phone

[19:19:20 - 19:19:20] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:19:23 - 19:19:28] Matt Crawford: we'll keep it up. So like my senior dispatcher. Like he came in with that ID. number and then I'm like, Okay, we get like when they're dispatch. They're in route, when they're on site when they leave, we got a summary. Oh my gosh, for summary is great and I'm like you like all those emails. Like I was telling them. Stop bugging you guys like, No, we'd love all that. I'm like, okay, like He's worked at a bunch of different areas. Like we need to be giving all these updates. I'm like, Oh, I wouldn't want all those emails.

[19:19:44 - 19:19:50] Scott Davidson: Hmm. Yeah. Yep.

[19:20:09 - 19:20:21] Matt Crawford: say we're gonna do. So in communicating effectively, we ensure the technicians, Is like, Okay, you don't want me to do it. No, try it And thus, the results that communicating, really. Effectively is what it boils down to, and we do what we we got. And so every customer is telling me that literally, like, bragging to me we're not doing anything spectacular. We're literally just giving we're just no matter, I'm, we're being dead serious. Like, you guys are doing great and you know, and them not showing us. So we make sure people show up for their, you know, 2026. It's like a big thing, right? People are just not as reliable as like, Hey, are you gonna be there? Is everything still good? Yeah, I'm still gonna, we ensure that we check the schedule, just like any good person would do good. So we avert issues before they become issues of, not checking with people, about How amazing, where am I know for? Like, Tell me, like, if we're making it, they used to be. guide me back on your question because I kind of got up on that tangent. Um so I so yeah so that's one thing that we're doing really well. You have to

[19:20:22 - 19:20:30] Scott Davidson: No, I think I think you answered it. well, the average order value you got into the kind of the differentiation but

[19:20:27 - 19:20:27] Matt Crawford: Oh yeah.

[19:20:28 - 19:20:39] Scott Davidson: yeah, in terms of the cycle and the value Hmm.

[19:20:48 - 19:21:42] Matt Crawford: right? So our average ticket, but you know, you may send five tickets a day, Yes, so the, so, that's a great question. Depend upon like, like location size gonna kind of. So our average ticket value is, I would say between two and $300, that coming locations have is going to be a drastic, You know, it's gonna, it's right? You may send 10. So that's And right now we're probably only have channel customers. I don't have any direct well yeah I don't have any specific direct customers now we're working on 90 and growing so they're all over the place so I guess two hundred three several that should come to fruition and so those are going to be you know if

[19:21:38 - 19:21:39] Scott Davidson: Discussion.

[19:21:38 - 19:21:58] Matt Crawford: switch and everything's back on like it's stupid simple. And there can be some 10,000 because we're out there for like two weeks doing like a virus for you I got one that's a thousand location to go on us 350 I got one that's about that might be like 185 dollars which is like we got out there and like flip to Generally, we can resolve something in two hours. Now there are there are ones dollars, an average service ticket if you will so that would be like two hours. mediation or something else so that where someone was you know, affected. that like Hey we're gonna be out there for you know I've had some of their And so that's break fix. And so, if we get into our qsr market, which we found a

[19:21:43 - 19:21:43] Scott Davidson: Capture.

[19:21:49 - 19:21:58] Matt Crawford: qsrs use quick server restaurant, there are tons of new brands, tons of small

[19:21:50 - 19:21:51] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:21:53 - 19:23:55] Matt Crawford: brands trying to grow. They're opening locations closing locations. They need stalls business and they're generally easy people to deal with. So one example brake fix right. They need their systems to work when they go down because it one that we're dealing with right now, like we got into them, This is like all cold. Like I I stumbled upon a video that that they had of one of our manufacturers that we deal with and like, hey, we love this solution and see if this is a play for us, where we can like, sell them this solution, they already got that were, there were a member of but then, Hey, we can do other then I started looking in terms, like, Oh, they got a hundred locations. Let me stuff. And like we are, you couldn't even email. These people, like, I was trying to email and I was getting blocked and so I got them on LinkedIn. I was like, Hey, like I'm trying to talk to you guys. And they're like, Oh, you know, you want to talk to her like Yeah, but y'all's email, servers blocking me. Oh, they opened it up for me and everything and I finally got through. We have a meeting. So they're planning on opening up. 25 stores a year. They've got about 90 something locations right now. So they're like, install their pos, okay? All they're everything like turnkey, not only doing projects for like opening new stores. All their low voltage, all their, like, they're sending people out to go do this stuff. So they're gonna use us to engaging us on break fix. We haven't got the first work order, but we're also that they, they're help center. They're looking at a System that were, you know, dial pad that were proposing to them. They're also looking at a network stack like ubiquity that we're partners with that they're looking to implement, you know, across the board cameras is another project. I mean, like you hit one customer and it's like, boom, they've got all the and Like you could be doing network, you could be doing cameras, you could do on each one of those is a specific vertical that could be like your own company. phone systems and here we come into one that they've got all these issues and we're able to solve them all. With different products and services and it all started out from wanting to do break fix. Same thing with my 350 location guy that's got warehouses. He wants brake fixed.

[19:23:49 - 19:23:49] Scott Davidson: Hmm.

[19:23:50 - 19:23:55] Matt Crawford: But now, he's got a camera project that he wants help with. He's got, he's

[19:23:58 - 19:23:58] Scott Davidson: God.

[19:24:21 - 19:24:26] Matt Crawford: interested in looking at dial pad and shoot. That's enough, like 350 locations interested in dial pad. That's three different. You know, products that is is not talking about projects which those projects, you know, hundreds of thousands all at once, would easily be, you know, could be 60,000 location easily. break fixed. I'm great with you want to look at a camera project and you're great. So those now you start talking about ticket values, those customers are of dollars, but millions of dollars that 350, location cameras. If they did them

[19:24:25 - 19:24:39] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Okay, that's helpful. Um, And then I at the beginning, I think you you kind of touched on CRM. Are you do? Well, what's CRM are using? Do you like it? Are you looking to do something else?

[19:24:40 - 19:24:43] Matt Crawford: So we currently use Zoho. What do you guys know about Zoho?

[19:24:44 - 19:24:48] Scott Davidson: I've used their email platform, I've not used their CRM but

[19:24:58 - 19:25:05] Matt Crawford: email platform, but they've got such immense suite of software. It's ridiculous. Yeah, we use Zoho for everything. So Zoho is and we, we have, we had there like So, I think, we charge like 50 bucks a month per user and we get access to books, which is our QuickBooks.

[19:25:10 - 19:25:10] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:25:15 - 19:25:21] Matt Crawford: The whole payments was processes. ACh Payments Credit Card payments, Zoho CRM, Zoho desk. Which does our ticketing, which isn't great. We're actually looking which is really their claim to fame. One of the most strongest software, suites at a software called Service Now. Have you heard of that one?

[19:25:19 - 19:25:22] Scott Davidson: It. Oh yeah, the future.

[19:25:22 - 19:25:22] Brenda Hali: Hmm.

[19:25:22 - 19:25:37] Matt Crawford: so that's and that's one that we keep hearing from our clients and so I'm we're looking to become like a dealer for them like a reseller as well because that's another opportunity with this one qsr that we came into they're looking at fresh desk and zendesk and if we're doing all this, right? We might

[19:25:34 - 19:25:35] Scott Davidson: 

[19:25:37 - 19:26:29] Matt Crawford: as well say, Hey, this is the whole enchilada and then you can integrate with us we're looking to bring on, but yeah. Zoho Zoho is what we use. I was sold on it before as they, hey, this is what we're going to use, but we're close to and the service work orders, but integrates with the phone integrates with, like ubiquity equipment, all that stuff like that. So, that's another vertical that potentially outgrowing it. I think. I mean, that could be like if we get that thousand unit customer, they're the ones that were like, you know what, what software you guys integrate with service now. And that's what kind of opened my eyes and the one that has 350 theme and then it integrates with our dispatch software, so that would that's locations, they use service now as well. So it seems to be kind of a reoccurring probably the direction we're gonna go for that. But we'll probably keep Zoho CRM. What do you guys prefer? Like, hubspot or

[19:26:30 - 19:26:33] Scott Davidson: Hmm, Brenda I think can speak to yeah.

[19:26:30 - 19:26:30] Matt Crawford: Yeah.

[19:26:42 - 19:26:48] Brenda Hali: is the differentiator but yeah, we're okay like for the for the work that we do. Yeah. We have used hubspot but we can integrate with taho internally. The structure is pretty similar. I think that the functionality, it's the thing that

[19:26:47 - 19:27:03] Matt Crawford: Yeah. I don't I don't know what we would do. I think we're probably gonna keep the

[19:26:48 - 19:26:52] Brenda Hali:  I think soccer soccer is. Okay. And

[19:26:51 - 19:26:54] Scott Davidson: But we can help if you wanted to do a hotspot implementation.

[19:26:59 - 19:27:24] Matt Crawford: host CRM like from my, you know, my different employees are just like, Hey, this we're doing the whole books. Zoho Click, which is our internal like slack messaging Zoho sign which is all like it's like a docusign solution. Our is just as good a Salesforce like this is, you know, the dashboard and then this really what they're known for and it's super affordable. And then you know, websites hosted to Zoho.

[19:27:25 - 19:27:25] Scott Davidson: 

[19:27:28 - 19:27:33] Matt Crawford: Project. Our project portal is I mean like I said it's 50 bucks a month and we get all that service, we could even get an email address if we want to, but we use G suite for that.

[19:27:33 - 19:27:51] Scott Davidson: Construction. Um, all right. So I guess, in terms of a couple of potentially allows questions would be, you know, what are your goals for? You know, working with an outside partner and then

[19:27:52 - 19:28:03] Matt Crawford: Hmm. Yeah so budget's a big a big thing, I mean we do have a budget, excuse me.

[19:27:53 - 19:28:00] Scott Davidson: If you thought about budget. and how, you know you mentioned like scaling over time potentially you know, Even thought about it.

[19:28:07 - 19:28:53] Matt Crawford: Sorry about that. Um, so yeah, budget is obviously an important factor to all this. I know marketing. It really expensive. I certainly want to Put money into the marketing, right? But as we are right now, like we've got Two primary contracts and that pays the bills. I mean, obviously what we're doing, we're doing okay on that, but we need additional clients and so, whatever partner that we do, if I the more clients that you're able to bring in the more that we're able to close the bigger budget that we're able to put back into that

[19:28:43 - 19:28:44] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:29:05 - 19:29:18] Matt Crawford: So, that's why I said, Let's like, start out. I want to get my feet wet. I want Let's use the money that that that's generating to continue to fund it, right? to, I want to see what you guys are able to do. And then from there, we can because you can't, like, just if you're feeding because it's not gonna happen in scale and I know that that's like an oxymoron with, like, email marketing if that makes sense, if something's working, hey, let's put more money into it. 30 days, right? It's gonna be like, you know, 90 to six months before you're really going to see what if anything is working. And that's an expensive, you know, six months.

[19:29:19 - 19:29:41] Scott Davidson: Yeah. doesn't work? So that's very helpful. But yeah, I'm not gonna say you're gonna month at start on that, you certainly knew know because you've done it, what have tons and tons of pipeline in a month, like three, three to six months. True. I think having the infrastructure is definitely good, you know, you get a

[19:29:38 - 19:29:38] Matt Crawford: Mm-hmm.

[19:29:40 - 19:29:41] Scott Davidson: Yeah, that's right.

[19:29:46 - 19:29:50] Matt Crawford: like not every lead is going to be an appointment but we want to we want to Well, as long as we're seeing the leads coming in I think right. I understand automate that process and we want to we want to just make it so that we can

[19:29:48 - 19:29:48] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:30:02 - 19:30:35] Matt Crawford: qualified, get appointments booked, and then it's up to us, then to close those, Get, get appointments booked. We want to qualify, we're gonna make sure they're right? And I understand that that pipeline is, is potentially going to take us this question before like, What is our our typical turnaround time? I mean, It's months. Generally, I mean, sometimes we can get in pretty quick, but, you know, it's generally going to be, you know, I my experience is, it's several months long right? In months being, you know, 90 to six months, right? Hey, we're gonna schedule a point. They put you off, you got to be persistent, like, I've been dealing with one guy. since June, he's got 300 locations, and I've been dealing with some June to give him emergency, after after, you know,

[19:30:43 - 19:30:52] Scott Davidson: Yeah, sure. Yeah.

[19:30:54 - 19:31:00] Matt Crawford: exception to every rule, right? But in my experience, it's, it's 16. It's 90 to you on that, but it's not like 30 days in my, in my and there's always an He cancels and reschedules and councils and reschedules. And I was like, gosh, like but those are the ones like nothing easy happens, really quickly, right, there's gonna have to be some effort put in, so I don't have a good answer for

[19:30:58 - 19:30:59] Scott Davidson: I see.

[19:30:59 - 19:31:51] Matt Crawford: six months 90 to 180 And then so further expectations are further goals that I'm trying to get out of. This is being able to have a strategic partner that I can count on that, we can continue to grow and expand and they are a, You know, they are a, they they're doing. They have experienced, they have a track record and they can help understand the market or they understand marketing like they're an expert in us figure out our process because I believe our process is a bit. Marketing will figure it out for you. Like someone that really knows what their field. It's not like someone that's their Hey my brother does email. Um, unique and into your McDonald's. Matt, like, we'll figure out everybody's I see a LinkedIn kind of working and a nice potentially see SEO working right. different things and then we'll go that route. So I see email marketing working, unique. But we just, we have a process where we figure it out and we test

[19:31:51 - 19:31:51] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:31:56 - 19:32:01] Matt Crawford: And then LinkedIn, kind of being the three, touch point, email LinkedIn, email LinkedIn, phone call text, something like that. Was generally where I see.

[19:32:00 - 19:32:03] Brenda Hali: Yeah. So

[19:32:00 - 19:32:04] Scott Davidson: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, so for some go ahead. Go Brenda

[19:32:03 - 19:34:36] Brenda Hali: Okay, so, yeah, a couple of things. Thank you so much for all the, all the case, we're super Data driven in my case is analytics marketing and also revenue comes like from big companies that drive intent and things like that. In my operations and revenue operations. Basically identifying the different processes information that you're provided. And, yeah, definitely. That's the thing that makes us different. So it's Scott's background, is mostly in finance and also he that you have because We know that, no, everything is just about the little we're sending. Like, I can sense, I can send you or give you somebody. That is like super interested, but then, if you kind of close or maybe you don't have like the right systems in place internally, maybe you don't even get that email, similar to the emails that you were sending to the to the company and then you don't know exactly what the email was not going through. I think that that's where our expertise comes because we understand that everything is systems data and processes. And also we clients that we have. So, I think that, that is how we cool help you. And we are focus heavily in ROI like, even internally in our company, but also for the always thinking when we work with people, We engage in the album process which is just the beginning of developing the pipeline. But if we see something that is broken down the road, either in tech have with, usually we work with founders or with partners, so we they accept our or in processes, or even in metrics that you could be tracking, we also suggest those type of things. Like, It depends a lot on the type of relationship that we recommendations, because they want to improve the company. But I think that, that's the difference here that we have That maybe we could we will try and the other question that. So we're not marketing experts, like we won't design your website or the branding, because you have any budget allocated, we can help you to develop like an RFP and send what we do. But we have a network of experts that could help you with that. If that to the people that we know and that are pretty good at doing this like that. That's not our expertise. We work with marketing experts, specifically, in branding. I think that mostly what you mention is like mostly branding days  and and we can suggest some some people our expertise is developing and aligning like people data processes for you to sell more and to have like actually RI

[19:34:37 - 19:34:41] Matt Crawford: So, when you say that, so are you guys not doing the email marketing? Or kind of like,

[19:34:42 - 19:34:42] Brenda Hali: Yeah.

[19:34:42 - 19:34:46] Matt Crawford: How? So that is the kind of your thing is is getting those systems set up and

[19:34:47 - 19:34:49] Brenda Hali: Absurds.

[19:34:48 - 19:34:50] Scott Davidson: Yes, it we do. Go ahead.

[19:34:51 - 19:34:51] Brenda Hali: Yeah.

[19:34:56 - 19:35:04] Matt Crawford: Right. I've got someone.

[19:34:59 - 19:35:04] Brenda Hali: When you were mentioning marketing, that junior at the website to be changed and also SEO. And we we know the basis. But I think that there are people that are experts in just doing all that processes.

[19:35:15 - 19:35:40] Matt Crawford: strategy within that email marketing that involves the website of like, Hey, like, if we're doing, If we have an email marketing, right there may be a Yeah, I've got someone kind of in mind but I certainly wouldn't mind looking at, directing them to this page or having the specific page. you know that those are, I mean all of it, kind of ties together and I know that and that's why I want to individual arena and then we all just work together to, you know, for on the want some of this, a jack of all trades. I literally won an expert in each same plan that we got to have the right. We got all be marching to the same Even if you're not necessarily doing it like that's, and I get that, I don't tune, if that makes sense.

[19:35:40 - 19:35:41] Scott Davidson: Okay.

[19:35:41 - 19:35:42] Matt Crawford: but,

[19:35:42 - 19:35:42] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:35:47 - 19:36:01] Brenda Hali: Yeah. But in lead generation and and demand and also developing different like living in sense and identifying the least and also testing the different Messaging that, that actually attracts people. That's Our niche and expertise.

[19:36:10 - 19:36:27] Matt Crawford: Okay, there's yeah, for sure. So that's I think, certainly I need all of that. Right? So we need the website and LinkedIn. I need to email marketing. I need the A/b testing. I need all that to figure out the direction that we're going. And so, sent it right? It just seemed like, maybe you got and you didn't again. It was You know, that brings you back to like the email that Steven or Scott? Whichever just public knowledge you guys kind of got it. So I feel

[19:36:26 - 19:36:27] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:36:28 - 19:36:39] Matt Crawford: You know, the the more we go along, maybe the better, you guys will be if you're able to ascertain this, then Hopefully, you're able to do well, what you say you're gonna do, right? Which is, you know, develop leads and pipeline.

[19:36:43 - 19:36:56] Scott Davidson: relationship you worked with like we won't set. We do the qualification as part Yeah and and just for some context on that on the, you know, previous of your ICP like we that wouldn't even happen. So there would never be square. The system that we create and email won't get sent to someone that doesn't fit

[19:36:53 - 19:36:55] Matt Crawford: I would never be.

[19:36:55 - 19:37:01] Scott Davidson: Unless The publicly available information is incorrect. it just wouldn't happen like that, so,

[19:37:04 - 19:37:09] Matt Crawford: Right, right, I get that. I mean it is I mean things happen, right? I get like one offs and everything else like that but when it's like every lead that we get is A is a single site. Like

[19:37:10 - 19:37:10] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:37:11 - 19:37:16] Matt Crawford: It's just it's frustrating. Like this is not that this isn't our ICP like, Where

[19:37:14 - 19:37:15] Scott Davidson: but,

[19:37:15 - 19:37:20] Matt Crawford: are you getting these leads from? So it's someone that doesn't know what they're doing and and that's who we deal

[19:37:17 - 19:37:17] Scott Davidson: Right.

[19:37:28 - 19:37:35] Matt Crawford: with. We dealt with like the cheapest guy, right? We want with, I came my brother does this and I you know it made sense. I understand about email deliverability and everything else with that, but they're missing this other key part was You know, ICP this is who we want. So,

[19:37:35 - 19:37:37] Scott Davidson: I see. and then,

[19:37:37 - 19:37:37] Brenda Hali: Strategy.

[19:37:38 - 19:37:40] Scott Davidson: Yeah, yeah, strategy. Which so we did a strategy next

[19:37:42 - 19:38:54] Matt Crawford: But and, you know, to their defense, I mean, they've got me, you see one that one Qsr has got a hundred locations? This 350 location, another three hundred locations of either one of those pans out like it was money. Well spent, you know, so, months but so I I wouldn't say I think our process for like Brenda like you were onboard that customer, I think there is a lot that can be done internally for like onboarding from like our accounting perspective but like the sales process. We'll see but we're still dealing with those. I mean it's been it's been some speaking of like you're like once that once it comes in the process of how we And and I'm pretty sure there's probably room. We generally do pretty good, like we're not getting laughed out of the room because we don't have something, right? We're they're interested, but maybe there is something that we could be something that we probably need to spend some more time on developing on what it doing better to close these deals better. Maybe, we're not saying something that we need to say. Maybe we don't have the collateral developed which I think is says so. far from perfect. Tons of processes that can be implemented and improved upon You know, all that right anywhere that we can improve. I know we're not perfect as any business I think, could could, you know probably benefit from

[19:38:56 - 19:38:58] Scott Davidson: Right. Yep. No totally

[19:39:13 - 19:39:18] Matt Crawford: how it work, how we would get the leads and then like what the cost is that we were spending with them. There is budget there. I just don't know what So, yeah, and then budget, like I said, I don't even know it. We had a budget say that your proposal. What's your, what's your proposing? You know how, it's the budget would look like for, for what you guys were proposing. So I want to associated with that.

[19:39:19 - 19:39:22] Scott Davidson: Okay, I'm just right taking some nuts. One second.

[19:39:34 - 19:39:40] Matt Crawford: then do you guys give like a guarantee like Okay, Matt Our goal is to provide 30

[19:39:35 - 19:39:46] Scott Davidson: Yeah. So we typically do like to do a minimum of three months because as you

[19:39:36 - 19:39:40] Matt Crawford: And I get do you guys work on like a monthly retainer, like a monthly fee and appointments a month for this amount or like how does y'all's strategy work or how do cells proposal work?

[19:39:46 - 19:39:51] Scott Davidson: mentioned, It's hard to save results before them or at least, you know.

[19:39:49 - 19:39:49] Matt Crawford: Mm-hmm.

[19:39:53 - 19:40:21] Scott Davidson: Make a decision, either way. A lot of what we're building is. The system and there's value in the system itself. So, you know, we're not at the point where we're saying, like we guarantee X number and it's so dependent on When we get into, When we get into a deal like we're working with one that has $100,000 contracts, right? Like maybe they need three or four.

[19:40:20 - 19:40:34] Matt Crawford: I don't think we even understand them ourselves to be honest with you. So,

[19:40:25 - 19:40:44] Scott Davidson: like being in your practice and understanding some of those things where we get For the whole year and they're conversion rate might be X. So without kind of with the metrics. Yeah. So that's and that's one of the areas we help with. So, You know, would you? We don't we don't want for you to

[19:40:44 - 19:40:50] Matt Crawford: Right.

[19:40:56 - 19:41:53] Scott Davidson: successful because it for us, right, makes us look good. So that's the way we We don't want to like after three months. If we're not guaranteed, like, we don't want to work with you either. Like we're interested, you know, you being typically run it like we haven't done it guarantee. Historically, we've we can we've also done like a hybrid. Um, Approach, where? There's a monthly fee and then performance. Based on, you know, number of meetings like that. So there's you know those are two different kind of approaches. And then we do project work. Like, hubspot implementation would be, you know, maybe like a fixed define project links, um, but it's at least it sounds to me right now. Like the main area of interest is the We do email and LinkedIn. So we tier the accounts based on it's in four plus states and XYZ that is a hundred out of 100 or 90 out of 100. Let's say you have four intent you know to qsr it has a hundred plus locations, tactics based on the tiering and then we would look over time and see. That would go to tier one. Tier two, Tier Three. And we would do different

[19:41:50 - 19:41:55] Matt Crawford: What do you mean by tier?

[19:41:55 - 19:43:02] Scott Davidson: Okay. So let's say you're you're number one focus right now is qsrs with 100 plus locations. if we identified those leads that would be a tier one customer and we would take a more Intensive Multituctor approach what we're doing. Hitting them on LinkedIn and as part of the automated system LinkedIn, email You know, all that stuff. And we would because LinkedIn is constrained by volume might not use AI in the copy to be super duper extremely personalized. It might based on number of centers and all these other things, whereas a tier two account might be like an always-on email. That's a little more generic. You be, you know, any Manufacturing facility over X and that, you know, the language is a little more generic, but it's always on with the emails. reallocated over time if you know, we identify that And then we would measure and see what's working. What's not working in Something's working better than something else, basically. Does that? Does that answer?

[19:43:03 - 19:43:07] Matt Crawford: It makes sense. So you are you making, are you like creating the content that's going out like the the emails and things that nature?

[19:43:09 - 19:43:12] Scott Davidson: We unless you have a problem with it, we would create the copy.

[19:43:13 - 19:43:21] Matt Crawford: You know, and then you're managing that you're managing based on our our ICP, and then,

[19:43:23 - 19:43:32] Scott Davidson: You, you would connect to.

[19:43:23 - 19:43:27] Matt Crawford: What about LinkedIn like you managing like my profile or the company's profile or how does that work?

[19:43:32 - 19:43:54] Scott Davidson: A software that is like a sending. It's kind of like smart lead for LinkedIn and it would be your account and the only data associated with it would be campaign. a response to our campaign it will show up in your inbox on that tool. So like if an employee told you I'm quitting on you know it wouldn't It wouldn't come through if they sent you a message on LinkedIn that said that. But if it's

[19:43:53 - 19:43:55] Matt Crawford: Hmm. Okay.

[19:44:00 - 19:44:05] Scott Davidson: you're not sending excess connection requests and dms in excess of that because um so it's really just for DMS and then we would need to talk about making sure you can get flagged all these other

[19:44:06 - 19:44:10] Matt Crawford: Yeah, for sure. I mean I don't do too much on LinkedIn. I just started using it more heavily as a recent um,

[19:44:10 - 19:44:10] Scott Davidson: Mmm.

[19:44:34 - 19:44:39] Matt Crawford: right. Like and doing, I do a time like I got a request this morning from, you know, but the Dunkin Donut operations guy. That's interesting. So you know, of I don't even have 500 connections. So I've got like 300, I think maybe 260 course, I'm gonna follow up on that one, I don't even know where that came from, something like that but I mean, I generally will get on there like, go through, but I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't have time to spend on email marketing, how that came about. But you know, interesting.

[19:44:41 - 19:44:41] Scott Davidson: Yeah.

[19:44:46 - 19:44:52] Matt Crawford: So do you guys do that? The, the company page, too. Like, Do you read it? You I know you don't do designing, but like, do you, I mean, how does that work? Like to get the page like optimize and be posting every day and Everything like that.

[19:45:11 - 19:45:53] Scott Davidson: We don't really I mean we can help optimize the about and you know, make sure but I there are tools, I can show you that you insert like your brand voice, the page is following like best practices. We typically don't create content, and schedule them out and all that stuff. So that's like a low costs option. To what you're attempting to accomplish and it, it can like generate posts for you kind of have that always going. And that can be a really good way to have inbound as well. And then we can do things like Website visitor deanonymization figure out who the account is and things like that, like we can get kind of crazy with that, so that's inbound. And then same with your LinkedIn. Like, if someone were to like your posts, we could go all of them basically. Um, so that could be, you know, way it kind That means your ICP. We would have a trigger that that would do something like of scales over time. um, from just doing the email and LinkedIn outbound

[19:45:54 - 19:45:55] Matt Crawford: Right. Okay.

[19:45:55 - 19:45:58] Scott Davidson: But yeah, hopefully that answers the question.

[19:46:04 - 19:46:37] Matt Crawford: No, it does. Yeah, for sure, I think that it needs to be redone like visually and I guess that goes along with the website. So we need to find a company that could help optimize it all all over. our our page and, you know, it's just nothing there just looks desolate so it needs to be having posts and it needs to be having information and just, you And that's that's something that I would like to be done because people do go to know, a bunch of stuff. No, I'd be interested to look at the pricing of the proposal though, for sure. And what that's going to include.

[19:46:40 - 19:46:41] Brenda Hali: Month.

[19:46:55 - 19:47:19] Matt Crawford: if the pricing makes more sense to give you a bonus based on based on like I mean I'm all about no I don't have a preference, whatever makes sense. I mean you're I'm all about rewarding for success so I'm not opposed to that as a as a hey, I guess how how successful you are. Like, I'm all about, just like commission. you know, if you if you book this many or whatever then you know, you can get this. I'm not opposed that at all because that means things are going in the right direction. Most likely

[19:47:26 - 19:47:26] Brenda Hali: For now.

[19:47:29 - 19:47:47] Matt Crawford: Okay that's perfect. All right well I appreciate it Scott and Brenda thank you so much.

[19:47:48 - 19:47:49] Brenda Hali: Thank you. Right.

[19:47:49 - 19:47:50] Matt Crawford: All right, y'all take care. All right.
