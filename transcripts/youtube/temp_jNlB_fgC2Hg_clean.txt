Hey everybody, I have had a lot of Hey everybody, I have had a lot of Hey everybody, I have had a lot of requests recently to go over how we requests recently to go over how we requests recently to go over how we structure a basic go to market structure a basic go to market structure a basic go to market infrastructure setup infrastructure setup infrastructure setup and and and I think for a while our main value I think for a while our main value I think for a while our main value proposition was to do just do it proposition was to do just do it proposition was to do just do it ourselves right and we've seen that ourselves right and we've seen that ourselves right and we've seen that especially for especially for especially for horizontal software or software horizontal software or software horizontal software or software platforms that almost anyone can use or platforms that almost anyone can use or platforms that almost anyone can use or a large segment of the market can a large segment of the market can a large segment of the market can uh just going and sending emails for uh just going and sending emails for uh just going and sending emails for clients alongside 10 or 20 BDRs does not clients alongside 10 or 20 BDRs does not clients alongside 10 or 20 BDRs does not work very well. They're account work very well. They're account work very well. They're account executives own a huge portion of the executives own a huge portion of the executives own a huge portion of the market. There's a lot of stepping on market. There's a lot of stepping on market. There's a lot of stepping on feet. And so lately, we've been having a feet. And so lately, we've been having a feet. And so lately, we've been having a lot of success with helping companies lot of success with helping companies lot of success with helping companies set up their go to market set up their go to market set up their go to market infrastructure, their outbound infrastructure, their outbound infrastructure, their outbound infrastructure, their revenue infrastructure, their revenue infrastructure, their revenue infrastructure. And I generally partner infrastructure. And I generally partner infrastructure. And I generally partner with people who are much more skilled on with people who are much more skilled on with people who are much more skilled on the HubSpot side of things. But I think the HubSpot side of things. But I think the HubSpot side of things. But I think I can at least explain the basics of how I can at least explain the basics of how I can at least explain the basics of how it works. I can do the basic HubSpot it works. I can do the basic HubSpot it works. I can do the basic HubSpot enrichment. But this is the full go to enrichment. But this is the full go to enrichment. But this is the full go to market architecture. What do I include market architecture. What do I include market architecture. What do I include in that? That is sending infrastructure. in that? That is sending infrastructure. in that? That is sending infrastructure. That's clay tables. That's stuff going That's clay tables. That's stuff going That's clay tables. That's stuff going in and out of HubSpot. Those in and out of HubSpot. Those in and out of HubSpot. Those automations. There's lead routing automations. There's lead routing automations. There's lead routing automations. automations. automations. And then finally, there's copywriting And then finally, there's copywriting And then finally, there's copywriting and and context generation. Um, I guess and and context generation. Um, I guess and and context generation. Um, I guess I would put copywriting into like a I would put copywriting into like a I would put copywriting into like a general prospect intelligence system general prospect intelligence system general prospect intelligence system because we use the prospect intelligence because we use the prospect intelligence because we use the prospect intelligence system to generate information that lets system to generate information that lets system to generate information that lets us do the copywriting. us do the copywriting. us do the copywriting. And I would also put like AI replies And I would also put like AI replies And I would also put like AI replies into the lead routing section. So, we'll into the lead routing section. So, we'll into the lead routing section. So, we'll get there. I don't want to explain too get there. I don't want to explain too get there. I don't want to explain too much before, but I do want to explain much before, but I do want to explain much before, but I do want to explain how we do fit these GTM infrastructure how we do fit these GTM infrastructure how we do fit these GTM infrastructure setups in just three months. Um, setups in just three months. Um, setups in just three months. Um, something interesting to note is that something interesting to note is that something interesting to note is that the bottlenecks are almost never on our the bottlenecks are almost never on our the bottlenecks are almost never on our side. There are so many things to side. There are so many things to side. There are so many things to consider and that's why it's so consider and that's why it's so consider and that's why it's so important to have a good discovery and important to have a good discovery and important to have a good discovery and audit phase within the first month. Now, audit phase within the first month. Now, audit phase within the first month. Now, a lot of companies are looking to get a lot of companies are looking to get a lot of companies are looking to get started really fast and they skip that started really fast and they skip that started really fast and they skip that and it actually ends up making things and it actually ends up making things and it actually ends up making things take longer. So, what are some common take longer. So, what are some common take longer. So, what are some common instances that we've seen or problems instances that we've seen or problems instances that we've seen or problems that we've seen uh working with our that we've seen uh working with our that we've seen uh working with our partners? Like we've had random ones partners? Like we've had random ones partners? Like we've had random ones where like gong calls have been where like gong calls have been where like gong calls have been disconnected for like three years. So, disconnected for like three years. So, disconnected for like three years. So, we have to go in and manually associate we have to go in and manually associate we have to go in and manually associate them and that ends up making the close them and that ends up making the close them and that ends up making the close loss campaigns take longer. And loss campaigns take longer. And loss campaigns take longer. And basically what I'm take say is like basically what I'm take say is like basically what I'm take say is like there are a set of fundamental go to there are a set of fundamental go to there are a set of fundamental go to market motions that most companies want market motions that most companies want market motions that most companies want to do and those generally if I if it was to do and those generally if I if it was to do and those generally if I if it was just dependent on me would take like a just dependent on me would take like a just dependent on me would take like a month right but the purpose of a goto month right but the purpose of a goto month right but the purpose of a goto market infrastructure market infrastructure market infrastructure is to involve the partner company who is to involve the partner company who is to involve the partner company who you're setting this up for and teach you're setting this up for and teach you're setting this up for and teach them how to use it and so generally that them how to use it and so generally that them how to use it and so generally that takes about 3 months. So I've scoped it takes about 3 months. So I've scoped it takes about 3 months. So I've scoped it out here kind of you know accurately as out here kind of you know accurately as out here kind of you know accurately as like first month is discovery and audit like first month is discovery and audit like first month is discovery and audit phase. Um phase. Um phase. Um second month or I should say month one second month or I should say month one second month or I should say month one as I'm calling it here is infrastructure as I'm calling it here is infrastructure as I'm calling it here is infrastructure setup and where like a majority of the setup and where like a majority of the setup and where like a majority of the intense work happens and then month two intense work happens and then month two intense work happens and then month two we're setting things up for the future we're setting things up for the future we're setting things up for the future doing education and things like that. So doing education and things like that. So doing education and things like that. So by all means I'm not the expert of all by all means I'm not the expert of all by all means I'm not the expert of all experts. Other people might structure experts. Other people might structure experts. Other people might structure their infrastructure setups for their infrastructure setups for their infrastructure setups for companies in different ways or they companies in different ways or they companies in different ways or they might be focused more on the the revenue might be focused more on the the revenue might be focused more on the the revenue architecture than the um go to market architecture than the um go to market architecture than the um go to market architecture. At the end of the day it architecture. At the end of the day it architecture. At the end of the day it all sort of feeds into each other. So all sort of feeds into each other. So all sort of feeds into each other. So let's just talk about the steps here. So let's just talk about the steps here. So let's just talk about the steps here. So discovery phase super important discovery phase super important discovery phase super important expectation setting what does a expectation setting what does a expectation setting what does a successful engagement looks like? And successful engagement looks like? And successful engagement looks like? And I've had to do a lot of work here I've had to do a lot of work here I've had to do a lot of work here because generally I I understood that because generally I I understood that because generally I I understood that companies would understand companies would understand companies would understand that go to market motions especially that go to market motions especially that go to market motions especially setting things up well for the future setting things up well for the future setting things up well for the future and and fixing years of mistakes and and and fixing years of mistakes and and and fixing years of mistakes and inefficiencies would take more than like inefficiencies would take more than like inefficiencies would take more than like 18 or or 30 days um before we started 18 or or 30 days um before we started 18 or or 30 days um before we started seeing like considerable pipeline seeing like considerable pipeline seeing like considerable pipeline generation. But this is super important. generation. But this is super important. generation. But this is super important. Set the expectation that like, hey, the Set the expectation that like, hey, the Set the expectation that like, hey, the first 30 days, we're not expecting to do first 30 days, we're not expecting to do first 30 days, we're not expecting to do anything other than get to know you and anything other than get to know you and anything other than get to know you and your systems. Month two is where the your systems. Month two is where the your systems. Month two is where the sending and the pipeline generation will sending and the pipeline generation will sending and the pipeline generation will ideally happen, but we've seen it take ideally happen, but we've seen it take ideally happen, but we've seen it take as long as 6 months. Like a good story as long as 6 months. Like a good story as long as 6 months. Like a good story from one of my engineers who used to be from one of my engineers who used to be from one of my engineers who used to be an SDR at a large multinational company an SDR at a large multinational company an SDR at a large multinational company was put in charge of finding outbound was put in charge of finding outbound was put in charge of finding outbound motions that worked. motions that worked. motions that worked. Month one, nothing. Month two, nothing. Month one, nothing. Month two, nothing. Month one, nothing. Month two, nothing. Month three, nothing. On and on and on. Month three, nothing. On and on and on. Month three, nothing. On and on and on. Month nine, they cracked it and started Month nine, they cracked it and started Month nine, they cracked it and started making the company millions of dollars. making the company millions of dollars. making the company millions of dollars. So, I'm not saying that outbound motions So, I'm not saying that outbound motions So, I'm not saying that outbound motions have to take that long. But you probably have to take that long. But you probably have to take that long. But you probably didn't crack ads on your first campaign. didn't crack ads on your first campaign. didn't crack ads on your first campaign. You probably didn't develop your other You probably didn't develop your other You probably didn't develop your other channels in one month or two months. I'm channels in one month or two months. I'm channels in one month or two months. I'm not saying the pipeline generation can't not saying the pipeline generation can't not saying the pipeline generation can't happen in the first month or the second happen in the first month or the second happen in the first month or the second month, but I like to temper expectations month, but I like to temper expectations month, but I like to temper expectations here. So we evaluate the team structure. here. So we evaluate the team structure. here. So we evaluate the team structure. Who are we going to be working with? Who Who are we going to be working with? Who Who are we going to be working with? Who is like we're going to leave at some is like we're going to leave at some is like we're going to leave at some point like Stellar Growth or whatever point like Stellar Growth or whatever point like Stellar Growth or whatever company that is setting up the company that is setting up the company that is setting up the infrastructure. We'll leave at some infrastructure. We'll leave at some infrastructure. We'll leave at some point. Who is going to own these things point. Who is going to own these things point. Who is going to own these things going forward? And that colors a lot of going forward? And that colors a lot of going forward? And that colors a lot of how we do this setup because how we do this setup because how we do this setup because oneoff niche campaigns that require like oneoff niche campaigns that require like oneoff niche campaigns that require like an insane amount of technical knowledge an insane amount of technical knowledge an insane amount of technical knowledge might not be possible. might not be possible. might not be possible. And so I'm always asking when I'm And so I'm always asking when I'm And so I'm always asking when I'm setting something up, who is going to setting something up, who is going to setting something up, who is going to own this? How can I teach them to own it own this? How can I teach them to own it own this? How can I teach them to own it properly? We do not want something just properly? We do not want something just properly? We do not want something just randomly breaking after six months and randomly breaking after six months and randomly breaking after six months and them them having to redo everything. them them having to redo everything. them them having to redo everything. Setting goals and expectations. We kind Setting goals and expectations. We kind Setting goals and expectations. We kind of already talked about this. Um what of already talked about this. Um what of already talked about this. Um what are the KPIs for success? Generally, are the KPIs for success? Generally, are the KPIs for success? Generally, really early on it looks like have we really early on it looks like have we really early on it looks like have we met with all the stakeholders? Do we met with all the stakeholders? Do we met with all the stakeholders? Do we understand what we want to do? Do we understand what we want to do? Do we understand what we want to do? Do we have a good scope that everybody agrees have a good scope that everybody agrees have a good scope that everybody agrees with? And then later on it's like how with? And then later on it's like how with? And then later on it's like how many positive replies are we getting? many positive replies are we getting? many positive replies are we getting? how many meetings are we getting? Um how many meetings are we getting? Um how many meetings are we getting? Um what is working? What is not? At the end what is working? What is not? At the end what is working? What is not? At the end of the day, the the threemonth GTM of the day, the the threemonth GTM of the day, the the threemonth GTM infrastructure goal is just to find out infrastructure goal is just to find out infrastructure goal is just to find out what is working and what is resonating. what is working and what is resonating. what is working and what is resonating. And And And that's going to pay dividends for you. that's going to pay dividends for you. that's going to pay dividends for you. If you're a SAS company and you find out If you're a SAS company and you find out If you're a SAS company and you find out this thing, these three things maybe this thing, these three things maybe this thing, these three things maybe that you thought would really resonate that you thought would really resonate that you thought would really resonate with the market don't, then we can move with the market don't, then we can move with the market don't, then we can move on and do something else. and you're not on and do something else. and you're not on and do something else. and you're not you're never going to spend money on on you're never going to spend money on on you're never going to spend money on on doing it if you did it properly ever doing it if you did it properly ever doing it if you did it properly ever again or you'll lean into what's again or you'll lean into what's again or you'll lean into what's working. And so there is this is the working. And so there is this is the working. And so there is this is the toughest part of any engagement is like toughest part of any engagement is like toughest part of any engagement is like goals and expectations. Um sales really goals and expectations. Um sales really goals and expectations. Um sales really wants their teams to have full wants their teams to have full wants their teams to have full calendars. Leadership really wants to calendars. Leadership really wants to calendars. Leadership really wants to make money and they're investing a lot make money and they're investing a lot make money and they're investing a lot of money into this G team of money into this G team of money into this G team infrastructure, right? So yeah, once infrastructure, right? So yeah, once infrastructure, right? So yeah, once we've met with all the stakeholders, we we've met with all the stakeholders, we we've met with all the stakeholders, we move into the audit phase. See what move into the audit phase. See what move into the audit phase. See what they've done in the past. Audit the CRM. they've done in the past. Audit the CRM. they've done in the past. Audit the CRM. How bad is it? How many contacts are in How bad is it? How many contacts are in How bad is it? How many contacts are in there? What do you guys think your there? What do you guys think your there? What do you guys think your target area market size is? We'll do a target area market size is? We'll do a target area market size is? We'll do a little bit of back and forth with AI to little bit of back and forth with AI to little bit of back and forth with AI to kind of understand your business a kind of understand your business a kind of understand your business a little bit. We'll also look through your little bit. We'll also look through your little bit. We'll also look through your sales calls. Like I will physically look sales calls. Like I will physically look sales calls. Like I will physically look through them rather than just feeding through them rather than just feeding through them rather than just feeding them to AI. And we'll come up with a them to AI. And we'll come up with a them to AI. And we'll come up with a scope that everyone agrees with. We scope that everyone agrees with. We scope that everyone agrees with. We decide to work together. Great. We've decide to work together. Great. We've decide to work together. Great. We've done all that ground work. we on board done all that ground work. we on board done all that ground work. we on board and we start to reserve the email and we start to reserve the email and we start to reserve the email infrastructure which is super important infrastructure which is super important infrastructure which is super important because I'm going to say this going because I'm going to say this going because I'm going to say this going forward is that companies must wait 30 forward is that companies must wait 30 forward is that companies must wait 30 days to send that serves two purposes days to send that serves two purposes days to send that serves two purposes one we decide what's really important in one we decide what's really important in one we decide what's really important in terms of outcome and then number two we terms of outcome and then number two we terms of outcome and then number two we don't get any uh like virgin domain don't get any uh like virgin domain don't get any uh like virgin domain flags from flags from flags from um like it just allows us to fully use um like it just allows us to fully use um like it just allows us to fully use the infrastructure if if you're sending the infrastructure if if you're sending the infrastructure if if you're sending from a new infrastructure ffstruure and from a new infrastructure ffstruure and from a new infrastructure ffstruure and the domains are only like two weeks old, the domains are only like two weeks old, the domains are only like two weeks old, you're going to get higher bounce rates. you're going to get higher bounce rates. you're going to get higher bounce rates. You're not going to get to utilize the You're not going to get to utilize the You're not going to get to utilize the infrastructure as well as possible. If infrastructure as well as possible. If infrastructure as well as possible. If there is like an event or something there is like an event or something there is like an event or something highly impactful, there might be an highly impactful, there might be an highly impactful, there might be an opportunity to use generic opportunity to use generic opportunity to use generic infrastructure, but I would discourage infrastructure, but I would discourage infrastructure, but I would discourage it. So then we move on to market it. So then we move on to market it. So then we move on to market research. This is the period in which if research. This is the period in which if research. This is the period in which if it hasn't been done already, I am it hasn't been done already, I am it hasn't been done already, I am understanding your business. My team is understanding your business. My team is understanding your business. My team is understanding your business. You are understanding your business. You are understanding your business. You are feeding us documentation that will help feeding us documentation that will help feeding us documentation that will help us understand your business and not us understand your business and not us understand your business and not because we don't trust you but we want because we don't trust you but we want because we don't trust you but we want to verify. We will go through market to verify. We will go through market to verify. We will go through market research with AI the best AI models that research with AI the best AI models that research with AI the best AI models that are available. This changes from time to are available. This changes from time to are available. This changes from time to time. We will decide how to segment your time. We will decide how to segment your time. We will decide how to segment your verticals especially if you're a verticals especially if you're a verticals especially if you're a horizontal SAS. This is really horizontal SAS. This is really horizontal SAS. This is really important. Um we'll go through important. Um we'll go through important. Um we'll go through ICP uh ICP um documentation. Basically, ICP uh ICP um documentation. Basically, ICP uh ICP um documentation. Basically, who is your who is your ICP? These who is your who is your ICP? These who is your who is your ICP? These documents are going to be the foundation documents are going to be the foundation documents are going to be the foundation for the future. What is your target area for the future. What is your target area for the future. What is your target area market? Like, who is the ideal person market? Like, who is the ideal person market? Like, who is the ideal person you want to work with? What are the you want to work with? What are the you want to work with? What are the ideal personas? Some companies have ideal personas? Some companies have ideal personas? Some companies have already done this. I like to at least already done this. I like to at least already done this. I like to at least add to it. I'm like, hold on. I I get add to it. I'm like, hold on. I I get add to it. I'm like, hold on. I I get that you think you know what you know. that you think you know what you know. that you think you know what you know. We're going to go through every single We're going to go through every single We're going to go through every single one of your best customers, all your one of your best customers, all your one of your best customers, all your customers, your best sales calls, all customers, your best sales calls, all customers, your best sales calls, all your sales calls, your turn customers. your sales calls, your turn customers. your sales calls, your turn customers. um anything that we can get our hands on um anything that we can get our hands on um anything that we can get our hands on and put that through a context model to and put that through a context model to and put that through a context model to understand what is going on there. While understand what is going on there. While understand what is going on there. While we're doing this, okay, so this is in we're doing this, okay, so this is in we're doing this, okay, so this is in tandem. We are setting up signals that tandem. We are setting up signals that tandem. We are setting up signals that will pay off dividends for the future. will pay off dividends for the future. will pay off dividends for the future. So website visitors is like So website visitors is like So website visitors is like non-negotiable. It's really helpful for non-negotiable. It's really helpful for non-negotiable. It's really helpful for um attribution. Um, if somebody comes um attribution. Um, if somebody comes um attribution. Um, if somebody comes and visits the website for the campaign and visits the website for the campaign and visits the website for the campaign because website visitor identification because website visitor identification because website visitor identification is not perfect, you will probably is not perfect, you will probably is not perfect, you will probably multiply that number by 2 to 5x to see multiply that number by 2 to 5x to see multiply that number by 2 to 5x to see who how many people are visiting your who how many people are visiting your who how many people are visiting your website from the campaign. And we're website from the campaign. And we're website from the campaign. And we're also setting up things like outbound also setting up things like outbound also setting up things like outbound sync that automatically sync with your sync that automatically sync with your sync that automatically sync with your CRM CRM CRM to know people who you sent to, are they to know people who you sent to, are they to know people who you sent to, are they coming in through other channels? That coming in through other channels? That coming in through other channels? That attribution is huge. Often we've seen attribution is huge. Often we've seen attribution is huge. Often we've seen that campaigns that would have otherwise that campaigns that would have otherwise that campaigns that would have otherwise be considered a failure by reply rate be considered a failure by reply rate be considered a failure by reply rate were actually successful in driving were actually successful in driving were actually successful in driving traffic to the website and getting traffic to the website and getting traffic to the website and getting interest. As I always say, at bare interest. As I always say, at bare interest. As I always say, at bare minimum, cold email sent to your target minimum, cold email sent to your target minimum, cold email sent to your target area market. Um maybe less targeted is a area market. Um maybe less targeted is a area market. Um maybe less targeted is a private ads network and you know great private ads network and you know great private ads network and you know great like Erin Oas said this. Um everybody like Erin Oas said this. Um everybody like Erin Oas said this. Um everybody at minimum can use it like that. Okay. at minimum can use it like that. Okay. at minimum can use it like that. Okay. So what are some other important signals So what are some other important signals So what are some other important signals we can So the signals that are top down we can So the signals that are top down we can So the signals that are top down are when you already have a company are when you already have a company are when you already have a company list. Signals that are bottom up are list. Signals that are bottom up are list. Signals that are bottom up are when you're adding to your TAM because when you're adding to your TAM because when you're adding to your TAM because of the signal. And so right what we're of the signal. And so right what we're of the signal. And so right what we're doing here is we're doing bottom up. doing here is we're doing bottom up. doing here is we're doing bottom up. We're adding to our TAM from these We're adding to our TAM from these We're adding to our TAM from these signals. Website visitors, signals. Website visitors, signals. Website visitors, ICP job changes and hires at a smaller ICP job changes and hires at a smaller ICP job changes and hires at a smaller list. We'll go into what we do when we list. We'll go into what we do when we list. We'll go into what we do when we map the whole TAM out. Um and then map the whole TAM out. Um and then map the whole TAM out. Um and then specific really specific niche. um specific really specific niche. um specific really specific niche. um signals like let's say companies that signals like let's say companies that signals like let's say companies that are sponsoring clinical trials that are are sponsoring clinical trials that are are sponsoring clinical trials that are not in institutions are your ICP we can not in institutions are your ICP we can not in institutions are your ICP we can do that using clinical trials.gov do that using clinical trials.gov do that using clinical trials.gov Okay, really important stuff. TAM Okay, really important stuff. TAM Okay, really important stuff. TAM mapping. Who are your best customers? mapping. Who are your best customers? mapping. Who are your best customers? What verticals do you want to target? What verticals do you want to target? What verticals do you want to target? What do you want to prioritize? Let's What do you want to prioritize? Let's What do you want to prioritize? Let's map this out as best we can. We're map this out as best we can. We're map this out as best we can. We're aiming for like 80%. Okay? We're not aiming for like 80%. Okay? We're not aiming for like 80%. Okay? We're not going to aim for 100% of your target going to aim for 100% of your target going to aim for 100% of your target area market in these in these 12 months. area market in these in these 12 months. area market in these in these 12 months. It's just not feasible. I think the It's just not feasible. I think the It's just not feasible. I think the people who who spend time doing 100% people who who spend time doing 100% people who who spend time doing 100% target market or ICP map, they're target market or ICP map, they're target market or ICP map, they're wasting their time. We are going for the wasting their time. We are going for the wasting their time. We are going for the 8020 here. Okay. We're also pulling in 8020 here. Okay. We're also pulling in 8020 here. Okay. We're also pulling in uh we're at this point um getting ready uh we're at this point um getting ready uh we're at this point um getting ready to launch the close loss campaign by to launch the close loss campaign by to launch the close loss campaign by analyzing um sales calls and and lost analyzing um sales calls and and lost analyzing um sales calls and and lost customers. customers. customers. Um we are doing we're taking the founder Um we are doing we're taking the founder Um we are doing we're taking the founder especially founder sales we're looking especially founder sales we're looking especially founder sales we're looking at the LinkedIn followers and likes and at the LinkedIn followers and likes and at the LinkedIn followers and likes and things like that. We're doing preparing things like that. We're doing preparing things like that. We're doing preparing a social campaign and then we're also a social campaign and then we're also a social campaign and then we're also analyzing your competitors potentially analyzing your competitors potentially analyzing your competitors potentially pulling your competitor followers for pulling your competitor followers for pulling your competitor followers for better campaign at the same time.
