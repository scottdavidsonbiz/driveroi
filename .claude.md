# Drive ROI Context Operating System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 16, 2024  
**Purpose:** GTM Operations Knowledge Base for Premium Partnership (Scott Davidson + Brenda Hali)

---

## System Purpose

This is a compounding knowledge system for Drive ROI, a premium GTM operations partnership specializing in:

- **Foreign companies entering US market** (International → US expansion)
- **Vertical SaaS GTM operations** (CFO tools, HR tech, construction software)
- **PE portfolio revenue operations** (Board-ready metrics, M&A integration)

**Goal:** Every client engagement, transcript, and piece of feedback compounds into our knowledge base, making future work faster, smarter, and more valuable.

## How to Use This System

### Core Principle: Compounding Knowledge
> "All of the work you've done already can be compounded on itself to better incorporate novel information." - Jacob (Context Engineering)

**This means:**
- New transcripts connect to existing insights
- Client feedback refines skills and positioning
- Lead magnets validate frameworks
- Everything improves everything else over time

### When Creating or Adding Content

1. **Always add front matter** (YAML metadata at top of file)
2. **Use taxonomy tags** (see `docs/taxonomy.md`)
3. **Link to related nodes** (use `integrates-with` and `references`)
4. **Create atomic nodes** when possible (one concept per file)
5. **Update connections** when adding new content

### When Using Skills

Skills use **progressive disclosure**:
- Load main `SKILL.md` first (core instructions)
- Load `references/` files only as needed
- This saves context window tokens

Example:
```
.claude/skills/cold-email-outreach/
  SKILL.md                    # Always loaded first
  references/                 # Loaded only when needed
    email-templates.md
    13-rules-of-engagement.md
```

## Knowledge Compounding Rules

### 1. Before Creating New Content
**Search for existing related nodes first**
- Don't duplicate frameworks
- Reference existing skills instead of recreating
- Build on what already exists

### 2. Client Feedback Loop
**Every engagement teaches us something:**
- Extract atomic insights from transcripts
- Create `client-feedback/[client]-[insight].md` nodes
- Link feedback to skills/positioning it improves
- Update skills/positioning based on feedback

**Example Flow:**
```
Marcos Transcript
  ↓ Creates atomic nodes
client-feedback/marcos-build-run-prove-handoff.md
  ↓ Refines
premium-positioning (adds new service model)
  ↓ Informs
cold-email-skill (mentions ongoing partnership)
  ↓ Used in
Next Lead Magnet (with improved approach)
  ↓ Generates feedback
New client-feedback node
  ↓ Refines everything again
```

### 3. Transcripts → Insights → Feedback Nodes → System Updates
**Process:**
1. **Transcript** stored in `transcripts/[date]-[client]-[topic]_transcript.txt`
2. **Insight** extracted to `content/insights/[date]-[client]_insights.md`
3. **Atomic feedback nodes** created in `client-feedback/[client]-[specific-insight].md`
4. **Skills/positioning updated** based on feedback nodes
5. **Next client benefits** from compounded learning

### 4. Lead Magnets Validate Frameworks
**When creating lead magnets:**
- Use existing skills and frameworks
- Document what worked/didn't work
- Create feedback node with learnings
- Refine skills for next client

**Example:**
- Trustap lead magnet used `cold-email-skill`
- We learned ICP research framework works for fintech
- Created `client-feedback/trustap-icp-fintech-validation.md`
- Next fintech client benefits from Trustap learnings

## Progressive Disclosure in Skills

### How It Works
Skills are structured to load context progressively:

```
SKILL.md (loaded first)
  ↓ References when needed
references/
  specific-framework.md
  templates.md
  examples.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Saves context window tokens
- Can have deep expertise without overwhelming Claude
- Only loads what's needed for specific task

### When to Use References
- Detailed frameworks (13 Rules of Engagement)
- Long templates (email sequences)
- Extensive examples (case studies)
- Tactical details (phrases to avoid)

### When to Keep in Main SKILL.md
- Core instructions
- Process steps
- Quality checks
- When to use this skill

- `main` - Stable, production positioning/skills
- `experimental/[topic]` - Testing new approaches
- `client/[name]` - Client-specific work

### What to Commit
- ✅ Skills updates
- ✅ Positioning updates
- ✅ Client feedback nodes
- ✅ Framework improvements
- ✅ Lead magnets (after client approval)
- ❌ Raw transcripts with sensitive info (unless anonymized)

## Quality Checks

### Before Adding New Content
- [ ] Does this duplicate existing content? (search first)
- [ ] Is front matter complete with all required tags?
- [ ] Are related nodes linked (`integrates-with`, `references`)?
- [ ] Is this atomic (one concept) or should it be split?
- [ ] Does this improve existing content (compounding)?

### Before Updating Skills
- [ ] Is this based on real client feedback? (not theoretical)
- [ ] Have we validated this approach works? (evidence)
- [ ] Are examples included in references/?
- [ ] Does this conflict with other skills? (consistency)
- [ ] Is progressive disclosure maintained? (not too much in main file)

### Before Updating Positioning
- [ ] Is this based on multiple data points? (not one-off)
- [ ] Does this reflect our actual capabilities? (honest)
- [ ] Are we differentiating from competitors? (unique)
- [ ] Can we deliver on these promises? (validated)

## Success Metrics

### System Health
- **Compounding Rate:** New content references existing nodes (target: 80%+)
- **Node Density:** Average connections per document (target: 3+ links)
- **Feedback Loop Speed:** Days from client feedback → skill update (target: <7 days)
- **Reuse Rate:** Skills/frameworks used in multiple engagements (target: 60%+)

### Business Impact
- **Proposal Speed:** Time to create client proposal (baseline: hours → target: minutes)
- **Quality:** Client feedback on customization (target: "feels made for us")
- **Learning:** New clients get benefit of all past learnings (measurable in results)
- **Competitive Moat:** Knowledge depth increases over time (vs. competitors starting from scratch)

---

## Maintenance

## Key Principles (Never Forget)

### 1. Everything Compounds
Every piece of content should make the system smarter. If it doesn't connect to existing knowledge or create new connections, ask why it exists.

### 2. Atomic Nodes > Monoliths
Better to have 10 small, well-linked nodes than 1 giant document. Atomic nodes can be recombined in infinite ways.

### 3. Real Feedback > Theoretical
Only update skills/positioning based on actual client feedback. Theoretical improvements don't compound.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Don't dump everything into context window. Load what's needed when it's needed.

### 5. Human + AI Readable
Front matter helps both humans and AI understand content without reading full document. Invest in metadata.

## This System's Competitive Advantage

**Most Consultants:**
- Start from scratch every client
- Don't capture learnings systematically
- Can't compound knowledge
- Linear improvement curve

**Drive ROI with Context OS:**
- Every client improves the system
- Learnings captured in atomic feedback nodes
- Knowledge compounds exponentially
- Exponential improvement curve

**Result After 10 Clients:**
- Consultants: Still figuring things out
- Us: 10X smarter, 10X faster, 10X more valuable

**This is our moat. Guard it. Grow it. Use it.**
