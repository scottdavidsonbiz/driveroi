## Anti-ICP (Not a Good Fit)

❌ **Fortune 500 / Large Enterprises**
- Reason: User wants "non-obvious" prospects
- Exception: If new division/product line needing flexibility

❌ **Companies <$5M Revenue**
- Reason: Too small to afford 3PL, likely self-fulfilling
- Exception: If recently funded Series A/B

❌ **Pure B2B with customer pickup**
- Reason: Don't need distribution/fulfillment
- Exception: If expanding to DTC channel

❌ **Digital-only products (software, media)**
- Reason: No physical goods to warehouse

❌ **Perishable food requiring frozen storage**
- Reason: BroadRange mentions "temperature-controlled" but not clear if frozen
- Check first before pitching
