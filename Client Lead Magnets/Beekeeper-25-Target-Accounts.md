## EMAIL SEQUENCES FOR BEEKEEPER

All sequences keep the "Tell The Full Story" framework but concise (<100 words opening, <75 words bump).

---

### SEQUENCE 1: FRONTLINE COMMUNICATION GAP
*For: Hospitality, QSR, Retail, Fitness with frontline workers without email*

**Target:** Chief People Officer, VP HR, Internal Communications Manager  
**Angle:** 60%+ of your workforce has no email - they're missing critical company updates

#### Email 1: Opening

**Subject:** Your frontline communication

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

Life Time just connected 42,000 team members across 180 clubs with Beekeeper—92% now actively use it as their communication hub.

Before, 60% had no email access. Corporate updates weren't reaching the floor. Engagement was low, turnover high.

Now? 40%+ check Beekeeper daily. Real-time updates, schedules, training, recognition—all in one mobile app. Communication went from tactical to strategic.

If {{Company}} has frontline workers without email, we should talk.

Worth 15 minutes?

{{Sender}}

**Word count:** 77 words

---

#### Email 2: Bump (Send 3-4 days later)

**Subject:** RE: Your frontline communication

**Body:**

Quick addition: Caribou Coffee hit 73% engagement across 800+ locations using Beekeeper.

The pattern we see: frontline workers want to be connected, but email doesn't work for them. Mobile-first does.

Is this a priority, or should I check back later?

{{Sender}}

**Word count:** 44 words

---

### SEQUENCE 2: COMPLIANCE & SAFETY RISK
*For: Construction, Convenience Stores, Manufacturing with safety/compliance focus*

**Target:** Chief Legal Officer, VP Operations, VP Safety, Chief People Officer  
**Angle:** Using WhatsApp/SMS creates compliance liability - Beekeeper eliminates that risk

#### Email 1: Opening

**Subject:** Your workforce communication compliance

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

Royal Farms moved 5,700+ frontline workers off WhatsApp to Beekeeper to ensure labor law compliance.

The risk: WhatsApp creates legal liability—no message timing controls, no compliance boundaries, no records for audits.

Beekeeper gave them secure, compliant communication. Result: mitigated lawsuit risk, improved retention, and created an environment for sales growth.

If {{Company}} has workers using personal messaging apps for work, we should talk.

Quick call?

{{Sender}}

**Word count:** 71 words

---

#### Email 2: Bump (Send 3-4 days later)

**Subject:** RE: Your workforce communication compliance

**Body:**

Different angle: Flagger Force improved safety metrics by 110% after implementing Beekeeper.

Safety protocols, incident reporting, real-time updates—all tracked and compliant. Their dispersed crews stay connected and safe.

Is compliance/safety a priority, or wrong timing?

{{Sender}}

**Word count:** 39 words

---

### SEQUENCE 3: OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY & PRODUCTIVITY
*For: Multi-location operations with paper-based processes, manual workflows*

**Target:** VP Operations, COO, Chief People Officer  
**Angle:** Digital checklists, forms, and automation eliminate paperwork and boost productivity

#### Email 1: Opening

**Subject:** {{Company}} operations question

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

Beekeeper helped Mission Ridge digitize their workforce operations—eliminated paper checklists, manual scheduling, and communication gaps.

The problem we see: multi-location operations run on paper, clipboards, bulletin boards. It's slow, error-prone, and impossible to track.

Beekeeper consolidates it: digital forms, task automation, shift schedules, training, and communication—all in one mobile app.

If {{Company}} is still using paper processes, let's talk.

Worth exploring?

{{Sender}}

**Word count:** 72 words

---

#### Email 2: Bump (Send 3-4 days later)

**Subject:** RE: {{Company}} operations question

**Body:**

Quick thought: Wells Enterprises connected 4,000 employees across multiple sites with Beekeeper, overcoming language barriers with inline translation.

Instant updates, streamlined processes, improved operational efficiency—all measurable.

Is this a priority now, or should I follow up in a few months?

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have [Slack/Teams/WhatsApp]"
**Response:** "Those tools work great for desk workers with laptops. But frontline workers don't sit at desks—they need a mobile-first solution built specifically for them. Life Time tried email and found 60% of their workforce couldn't access it. Beekeeper is purpose-built for frontline workers."

### "Our employees won't adopt another app"
**Response:** "That's the most common concern we hear. Life Time achieved 92% adoption with Beekeeper—higher than any tool they'd rolled out before. The difference? Beekeeper is genuinely useful for frontline workers: schedules, paystubs, shift swaps, recognition. It's not another tool—it's THE tool they check daily."

### "This sounds expensive"
**Response:** "Royal Farms calculated the ROI in 6 months. The cost of turnover alone—recruiting, training, lost productivity—far outweighs the investment. Plus, the compliance risk mitigation from moving off WhatsApp was invaluable. Happy to share how similar companies justify the investment."

### "We're not ready to change our communication tools"
**Response:** "I totally understand. Most of our customers weren't actively looking either—they just hit a breaking point where the old way stopped working. Happy to check back in a few months. What would need to change for this to become a priority?"

### "We need to see an ROI calculation first"
**Response:** "Makes sense. Typical ROI drivers we see: (1) Turnover reduction - even 5% improvement saves $X based on your workforce size, (2) Productivity gains - digitizing manual processes saves Y hours/week, (3) Compliance risk mitigation - one lawsuit costs more than 5 years of Beekeeper. Want me to model this for {{Company}}?"
