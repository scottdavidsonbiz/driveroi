## Anti-ICP (Not a Good Fit)

❌ **Early-stage startups (Pre-Series A)**
- Reason: Too expensive, no enterprise deals yet
- Exception: If backed by top-tier VCs requiring compliance

❌ **Companies with strong internal compliance teams**
- Reason: Prefer to source auditors independently
- May still buy for platform/automation

❌ **B2C companies without enterprise sales**
- Reason: No compliance pressure from customers
- Exception: Healthcare B2C (HIPAA required)

❌ **Companies on strict budgets**
- Reason: Thoropass premium-priced vs. alternatives
- Competitor: Vanta, Drata (cheaper options)
