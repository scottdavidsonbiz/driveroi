## WITH LOOK-ALIKE COMPANY

Use these when Clay has a testimonial/look-alike company populated.

### Variant 1 - Direct/Professional (short)

**Subject:** How {{company}} approached insurance differently

Hey {{first_name}},

We've helped companies like {{company}} save thousands on insurance.

Most brokers take up to 30% in commissions—so they're not exactly motivated to lower your premiums. We charge a flat fee instead.

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if there's something similar for you?

### Variant 2 - Cheeky/Challenger (medium)

**Subject:** Your broker's taking you golfing. We'll save you money.

Hey {{first_name}},

Traditional insurance brokers make up to 30% commission on your premiums. So when they take you to lunch, just know who's paying.

We've helped companies like {{company}} save thousands by doing the opposite—flat fees, no commission.

One of our customers put it best: "Instead of taking you golfing, they will actually save you money."

Happy to show you what we find in 15 minutes.

Hey {{first_name}},

When's the last time someone looked at your insurance who wasn't paid to keep it expensive?
