## KEY DIFFERENCES: MID-MARKET VS. ENTERPRISE

### Why These Targets Are Better:

| **Factor** | **Enterprise List (Original)** | **Mid-Market List (This One)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Brand Recognition** | Household names (Wawa, Equinox) | Regional brands, less known nationally |
| **Employee Count** | 20,000-100,000+ | 1,500-25,000 |
| **Locations** | 500-2,500+ | 50-900 |
| **Decision Maker Access** | Hard to reach C-suite | Easier to reach, fewer gatekeepers |
| **Sales Cycle** | 12-18 months | 3-6 months |
| **Competition** | Every vendor calling them | Less saturated, more opportunity |
| **Budget Approval** | Multi-layer, board involvement | CEO/CFO can approve directly |
| **Likely on Beekeeper Radar?** | YES - sales team probably knows them | NO - under the radar, hidden gems |
| **Ownership** | Public or PE mega-deals | Family-owned, smaller PE, employee-owned |
| **Growth Stage** | Mature, optimizing | Rapid growth, need infrastructure NOW |

## RESEARCH TIPS FOR MID-MARKET

### Finding Decision Makers:
1. **LinkedIn** - Much easier to find & connect with C-suite at mid-market
2. **Company website** - Often lists full leadership team
3. **Local business journals** - Profile new hires, promotions
4. **Industry conferences** - Easier to meet them in person

### Trigger Events to Watch:
1. **Recent IPO** (Dutch Bros, Portillo's) - Need enterprise infrastructure
2. **PE acquisition** (Zaxby's, Bojangles) - New owners demand metrics/efficiency
3. **Rapid expansion** (Orangetheory, Dutch Bros) - Culture breaking, need systems
4. **Unionization efforts** (Amy's Kitchen) - Need better worker communication
5. **Safety incidents** (Manufacturing/Construction) - Heightened compliance focus
6. **Seasonal hiring surge** (Resorts, Great Wolf) - Onboarding pain is acute

### Where to Find Company News:
- **Local business journals:** "Denver Business Journal", "Portland Business Journal", etc.
- **Industry publications:** *Restaurant Business*, *Convenience Store News*, *Club Industry*
- **Glassdoor reviews:** Search "communication" - if employees complain, timing is perfect!
- **LinkedIn job postings:** Hiring for "Internal Communications Manager"? Perfect trigger!

## UPDATED EMAIL SEQUENCES

*(Same 3 sequences, but with mid-market adjustments)*

### Key Adjustments for Mid-Market:
1. **More personal tone** - These companies value relationships over corporate speak
2. **Reference regional identity** - "Wisconsin-based family culture" resonates
3. **Emphasize speed** - "Implemented in 90 days" vs. "12-month rollout"
4. **Family/culture language** - Use "team" not "workforce", "culture" not "engagement metrics"
5. **Easier ROI** - Smaller numbers are more tangible ($150k savings vs. $5M)

### SEQUENCE 1: FRONTLINE COMMUNICATION GAP (Mid-Market Version)

**Subject:** {{Company}} frontline communication

**Body:**

Hi {{First_Name}},

Caribou Coffee connected 800+ locations with Beekeeper—73% of their frontline team now actively engaged.

Before: corporate updates weren't reaching baristas, turnover was high, culture felt disconnected during expansion.

Now: everyone's on the same page. Real-time updates, schedules, recognition—all mobile-first.

If {{Company}} is growing fast and worried about losing your culture, let's talk.

Quick call?

**Word count:** 62 words

### SEQUENCE 2: COMPLIANCE & SAFETY (Mid-Market Version)

**Subject:** {{Company}} compliance question

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

Royal Farms (5,700 workers) moved their frontline off WhatsApp to Beekeeper for labor law compliance.

The risk: personal messaging apps create legal liability—no audit trail, no message timing controls.

Beekeeper eliminated that risk, improved retention, and mitigated lawsuit exposure.

If {{Company}} has team members using WhatsApp/SMS for work, we should talk.

Worth 15 minutes?

## OBJECTION HANDLING: MID-MARKET SPECIFIC

### "We're too small for this"
**Response:** "Actually, mid-market is our sweet spot. We just added 150+ companies like Polytainers, Rio Hotel & Casino, and Tree Top—all in that 500-5,000 employee range. Ricola (similar size to you) uses Beekeeper. Implementation is faster than enterprise—typically 60-90 days, not 12 months."

### "We don't have budget for this"
**Response:** "Fair. Most of our mid-market customers find budget within 3 months by calculating turnover savings. If you're losing even 10 frontline workers a year, and each replacement costs $5k (recruiting + training), that's $50k. Beekeeper pays for itself by reducing turnover 5-10%. Want me to model it for {{Company}}?"

### "Can we wait until next year?"
**Response:** "Totally understand. The companies that wait usually call us back when they hit a breaking point—major safety incident, failed inspection, key employees quit because they felt disconnected. The advantage of implementing now? You prevent that crisis. But happy to check back in Q1 if timing's better."

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Tier 1** (Dutch Bros, Portillo's, Orangetheory, Boyne, Amy's Kitchen)
2. **Research each company** on Glassdoor - look for "communication" complaints in reviews
3. **Find decision maker** on LinkedIn - connect with personalized note
4. **Send Email 1** - Use sequence matching their pain
5. **Follow up in 3-4 days** with Email 2
6. **Track results** - Which industries respond best?

**Last Updated:** December 15, 2025

**Key Insight:** Mid-market companies are **underserved** by enterprise software vendors. They're eager for solutions but want fast implementation, clear ROI, and vendors who understand their growth stage. These 25 accounts are hidden gems that Beekeeper's enterprise sales team likely hasn't prioritized yet.
