# 25 High-Fit Accounts for Symbiotic Security

**Prepared by DriveROI | Scott Davidson | scott@driveroi.com**

---

## Your ICP (Based on Existing Customer Analysis)

We analyzed your current customers (Mercury Bank, Trustpair, Hugging Face, Adaptive ML, Packmind, Lendis) and identified the pattern:

| Signal | Why It Predicts Fit |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Developer-heavy org (20-200+ devs)** | More developers using AI coding tools = more unreviewed AI-generated code |
| **Handles regulated/sensitive data** | Financial, health, or PII data means a code vulnerability has real consequences |
| **Series B+ or well-funded** | Has budget for dev tooling and security infrastructure |
| **API-first or platform business** | Their code IS the product. Vulnerabilities affect downstream customers, not just them |
| **Compliance requirements** | SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS create pressure to prove code security |

**Buyer personas:** VP/Head of Engineering, CISO/Head of AppSec, VP Platform/Developer Experience

## AI/ML Companies (5 Accounts)

| # | Company | What They Do | Employees | Funding | HQ | Pain Angle |
|---|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|-----|------------|
| 9 | **Modal Labs** | Serverless GPU cloud for AI developers | 100-200 | Series B ($87M, $1.1B val) | New York | Customers run proprietary ML models and training data on Modal. Vulnerability could expose model weights or enable compute theft. |
| 10 | **Snorkel AI** | Data-centric AI platform for ML training | 100-200 | Series C ($85M, $1B val) | Palo Alto | Handles proprietary training datasets for Fortune 500. Breach exposes confidential data used for competitive AI models. |
| 11 | **Abacus.AI** | Enterprise AI platform (chatbots, forecasting, personalization) | 100-300 | Series B+ | San Francisco | Customers integrate Abacus into sensitive business workflows. Code vulnerabilities could leak customer data or model IP. |
| 12 | **Beam Cloud** | Serverless GPU platform for AI workloads | 30-100 | Series A | San Francisco | Python SDK for developer workflows. Vulnerability could enable GPU hijacking, model theft, or data exfiltration from training runs. |

## B2B SaaS Handling Sensitive Data (6 Accounts)

| # | Company | What They Do | Employees | Funding | HQ | Pain Angle |

| 16 | **ChartHop** | People analytics and org planning platform | 100-250 | Series B ($35M) | New York | Stores salary data, equity grants, performance reviews. Breach exposes the most sensitive HR data a company has. |
| 17 | **Chainguard** | Software supply chain security (secure container images) | 100-200 | Series A ($50M) | Seattle | Sells "secure by default." If their own code has AI-generated vulnerabilities, it undermines their entire value prop. |
| 18 | **Column Tax** | Embedded tax software for fintech apps | 30-80 | Series A ($21.7M) | New York | Handles SSNs, income data, tax returns. One code vulnerability = breach of tax PII for thousands of users across fintech clients. |

## Bonus: Developer Infrastructure

| # | Company | What They Do | Employees | Funding | HQ | Pain Angle |
|---|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|-----|------------|
| 25 | **Modal Labs** | (Listed above in AI/ML - duplicate removed. Replaced below) |

**25. Navan**

## Why These Companies, Not Others

**We filtered out:**
- Companies with 1,500+ employees (enterprise sales cycle too long for seed-stage)
- Obvious household names (Stripe, Datadog, Cloudflare)
- Companies without meaningful dev teams
- Consumer-only companies (no compliance pressure)

**We prioritized:**
- API-first businesses (their code IS the product)
- Regulated data handlers (consequences of a breach are real)
- Companies scaling engineering teams (more AI coding tool adoption)
- Platform businesses (vulnerability affects downstream customers, not just them)

## Outreach Angle

The pitch isn't "your code might have bugs." It's:

> "Your developers are shipping faster with AI coding tools. Your AppSec team is reviewing the same volume of code they were before. The gap between what's being written and what's being reviewed is growing every sprint."

For regulated companies, add:

> "When your auditor asks how you're securing AI-generated code, what's the answer today?"
