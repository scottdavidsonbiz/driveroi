# Market Development Fund (MDF) Business Case
## Direct Customer Acquisition Program for SMB Service Businesses

**Prepared for:** Channel partner vendors (Peplink, AT&T, Verizon, Cradlepoint, etc.)
**Prepared by:** Deployed Dynamics
**Date:** January 2026
**Program Duration:** 6 months
**Requested MDF Investment:** $30,000

---

## Executive Summary

Deployed Dynamics is launching a **direct customer acquisition program** targeting SMB service-based businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, construction, franchises) to drive demand for business connectivity solutions. This program will generate qualified opportunities for enterprise-grade networking equipment and business Internet services, demonstrating measurable ROI for vendor partners through structured outbound campaigns and documented results tracking.

**Key Outcomes:**
- 50-100 qualified sales conversations per month (months 4-6)
- 10-20 closed deals per month at scale
- Documented proof of direct demand generation (reducing dependency on carrier rep referrals)
- Strengthened channel partner tier status through demonstrated market activation

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Channel partners in the connectivity space historically rely on **inbound leads from carrier representatives**. While this model works, it creates three challenges:

1. **Vendor Pressure:** Carriers and OEMs increasingly expect partners to demonstrate direct demand generation, not just order-taking
2. **Pipeline Dependency:** 100% reliance on carrier reps creates vulnerability to program changes and rep turnover
3. **Limited Growth:** Partners who can't show proactive customer acquisition struggle to achieve top-tier status and preferential treatment

### The Opportunity
SMB service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, construction, franchises) represent a high-volume, underserved market for business connectivity solutions. These businesses have:
- **Mobile workforce needs** (field technicians with tablets, connected vehicles)
- **Field payment enablement** (tablets for on-site invoicing and payment)
- **Multi-location connectivity** (franchises, growing businesses opening 2nd/3rd locations)
- **Unreliable consumer-grade equipment** (ready to upgrade to business-grade solutions)

Most of these businesses don't know business-grade connectivity solutions exist—they use consumer routers from Best Buy or whatever the carrier gives them. **This is an awareness problem, not a demand problem.**

## Budget & Investment Request

**6-Month Program Fee:** $30,000

---

## Expected ROI for Vendor Partners

### Direct Revenue Impact

**Conservative Scenario (10 deals/month by Month 6):**
- 10 deals/month × $550 average hardware sale = $5,500/month hardware revenue
- 10 deals/month × $100/month connectivity × 24 months = $24,000 LTV per month cohort
- **6-month program = 30 total deals = $16,500 hardware + $72,000 LTV**

**Aggressive Scenario (20 deals/month by Month 6):**
- 20 deals/month × $550 average hardware sale = $11,000/month hardware revenue
- 20 deals/month × $100/month connectivity × 24 months = $48,000 LTV per month cohort
- **6-month program = 60 total deals = $33,000 hardware + $144,000 LTV**

### Vendor Benefit Calculation

**For $30,000 MDF Investment:**
- Conservative (30 deals): 3X total ROI
- Aggressive (60 deals): 6X total ROI

### Strategic Benefits (Non-Monetary)
1. **Proof of Direct Demand Generation:** Documented proof partner is actively driving market demand, not just taking inbound leads
2. **Carrier Rep Preference:** Partners who show direct motion get 5-10x more inbound referrals from carrier reps (multiplier effect)
3. **Tier Status Protection:** Maintains or upgrades partner tier status through demonstrated market activation
4. **Competitive Positioning:** Differentiation vs other partners who only wait for inbound leads

## Risk Mitigation

### What if results underperform?

1. **Phased approach:** Start small (Months 1-2), scale only after proven results
2. **Data-driven optimization:** Weekly tracking allows rapid pivots if messaging/ICP isn't working

### What if results overperform?

## Appendix: Sample Outbound Messaging

### Email Example 1: Field Payment Enablement

**Subject:** Are your HVAC techs still waiting on invoices to get paid?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Are your field techs able to collect payment on-site, or are you still sending invoices and waiting 30+ days to get paid?

We help HVAC companies like [Company Name] set up tablets with business-grade connectivity so your techs can:
- Close deals in the driveway (not 3 weeks later)
- Process payments on-site
- Update job status in real-time

No more consumer-grade routers that drop signal. We provide enterprise equipment with external antennas that work in metal buildings, basements, job sites—anywhere your techs need to work.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Company Name]?

### Email Example 2: Multi-Location Expansion

**Subject:** Opening a 2nd location?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I saw [Company Name] is expanding to [City]—congrats!

Quick heads up: Most business owners use whatever Internet the carrier gives them at their new location. Usually it's consumer-grade equipment that can't handle multiple users, VoIP calls, and cloud software all at once.

We specialize in business-grade connectivity for growing service companies—better routers, external antennas for metal buildings, and backup connectivity so you never lose connection to your field team.

If you're setting up new locations this year, worth a quick call to make sure your Internet doesn't become a bottleneck.

Available this week?

### LinkedIn Message Example

**Connection Request Note:**
Hi [First Name]—saw you're growing [Company Name] in [City]. We help HVAC/plumbing companies set up business-grade connectivity for field teams. Would love to connect!

**Follow-up Message (after connection accepted):**
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

We work with a lot of [Industry] companies helping them get reliable connectivity for field operations—tablets for payment processing, real-time job updates, connected vehicles, etc.

Most businesses don't realize consumer-grade routers aren't built for this. We provide enterprise equipment (external antennas, backup connections, provisioned devices) at competitive pricing.

If connectivity is on your radar at all, happy to share what we're seeing work for companies like yours. 15-minute call?
