# Engagement Proposal: Deployed Dynamics Direct Customer Acquisition Program

**Prepared for:** Bryan Ilg, Deployed Dynamics
**Prepared by:** Scott Davidson & Brenda Hali
**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Meeting:** Wednesday, 1:00 PM

---

## What You Asked For

From our January 9 discovery call, you need:

1. **MDF Business Case** - A document you can shop to OEMs (Peplink, etc.) and carriers (AT&T, Verizon) to unlock $25K-$50K in marketing development funds
2. **Direct Customer Acquisition Motion** - A basic lead gen system targeting SMB service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, construction)
3. **Something Lightweight** - Not a "million years" of work, just enough to get started and test

**Our Recommendation:** $5K-$6K/month retainer for 3-6 months to build, execute, and optimize your direct motion while you shop the MDF case.

## Pricing & Terms

### Option 1: Month-to-Month Retainer (Recommended)
**Price:** $5,500/month
**Commitment:** 3-month minimum (Months 1-3)
**After Month 3:** Continue month-to-month or pause based on results

**Why This Works:**
- Low risk for you (3 months vs 12-month contract)
- Aligned with MDF timeline (you'll know by Month 2-3 if vendors approve)
- Easy to scale up if MDF secured, or wind down if not

---

### Option 2: Project-Based (Alternative)
**Price:** $15,000 one-time (Months 1-3 bundled)
**Deliverables:** Everything in Phase 1 + Phase 2 (MDF case, ICP, lists, copy, CRM, execution)
**After project:** $3,000/month ongoing retainer for continued execution (optional)

**Why This Works:**
- Predictable total cost upfront
- Easier to expense as "project" vs ongoing service
- Lower monthly cost after initial buildout

---

## Why This Pricing Makes Sense

### What You're Getting for $5,500/Month
- Fractional GTM team (strategy + execution + analytics)
- 40-60 hours/month of work (split between Scott & Brenda)
- Equivalent to hiring a $80K/year GTM specialist, but:
  - No benefits, no ramp time, no management overhead
  - Two people with complementary skills (ops + automation)
  - Cancel anytime after Month 3

### Market Comparison
| **Option** | **Cost** | **What You Get** |
|---|---|---|
| **Hire full-time GTM person** | $80K-$100K/year | 1 person, 3-6 month ramp, benefits |
| **Freelance Clay specialist** | $3K-$5K/month | Execution only, no strategy |
| **GTM consultant** | $8K-$15K/month | Strategy only, limited execution |
| **Us** | $5.5K/month | Strategy + Execution + Analytics + Results |

## FAQs

**Q: Can I just pay for the MDF business case and not the retainer?**
A: The MDF case is included as part of this proposal. You already have it. The retainer is for actually executing the program (building lists, writing copy, running campaigns, tracking results).

**Q: What if I want to do some of this myself?**
A: Totally fine. We can do "advisory only" for $2K-$3K/month where we guide you but you execute. But honestly, most business owners don't have time—that's why the retainer model works better.

**Q: Do you take a percentage of deals closed?**
A: No. We charge a flat monthly retainer, not commission. This keeps incentives aligned (we focus on qualified pipeline, not just volume).

**Q: What if the AT&T launch goes slower than expected?**
A: Direct motion is independent of AT&T channel. Even if AT&T is slow, you'll have your own pipeline. And when AT&T ramps up, you'll have proof of direct demand to show them.

**Q: Can we start smaller than $5,500/month?**
A: We could do a one-time $5K project for just the MDF case + ICP + list building, then you decide later if you want execution. But ongoing execution is where the value compounds.
