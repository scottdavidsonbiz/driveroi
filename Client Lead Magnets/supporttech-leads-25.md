## Outreach Messaging Angles

### Angle 1: Multi-Location Pain Point
**Subject:** Managing IT across [X] locations?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] now has [X] locations across [Y] states. That's impressive growth.

Question: How are you handling network deployments and tech support when you open a new [store/clinic/school]? Most companies your size either:
1. Fly someone from HQ (expensive, slow)
2. Use random local vendors (inconsistent quality)

We've been helping multi-location businesses like [Similar Company] with nationwide field services for 45+ years. One partner, consistent quality, 2-hour emergency response anywhere in the US.

Worth a quick call to see if we can help?

### Angle 2: Relocation Support
**Subject:** [Company Name] relocating soon?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Saw you're [opening a new location / relocating HQ / expanding]. Congrats!

Quick question: Who's handling the IT side of the move? Most companies underestimate the complexity—network cutover, equipment moves, testing before go-live, etc.

We specialize in IT relocation support (pre-move audits, day-of coordination, post-move support). Been doing this for 45+ years across hospitality, healthcare, education, and retail.

If you're in planning mode, happy to share what we typically see go wrong (and how to avoid it).

### Angle 3: IT Staffing Gaps
**Subject:** Need IT boots on the ground?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Random question: Are you short on IT staff right now? I'm seeing a lot of [Industry] companies struggling to keep up with [new locations / tech projects / support tickets].

We provide W-2 IT technicians (not contractors) for project work, deployments, or temp-to-perm staffing. Nationwide coverage, 2-hour response for emergencies.

Worth a conversation if you're feeling stretched thin?
