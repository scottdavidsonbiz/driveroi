**Subject:** 25 Target Accounts for Support Tech (Field Services, Relocation, Staffing)

---

Hi [First Name],

Following up on our conversation—I put together a target account list for Support Tech based on your field services, IT relocation, and staffing capabilities.

**Attached:**
- **25-company lead list** (CSV for easy import)
- **Full research breakdown** (PDF with company profiles, buying signals, and messaging angles)

## What's In This List

I focused on **non-obvious prospects**—mid-market multi-location businesses (not Fortune 500s everyone is chasing) that fit your sweet spot:

**By Industry:**
- **Hospitality:** Growing hotel/restaurant chains (Hyatt Place, First Watch, CAVA, etc.)
- **Healthcare:** Multi-clinic networks expanding rapidly (Carbon Health, Village Medical, ChenMed)
- **Education:** Universities and charter school networks (Grand Canyon University, Charter Schools USA)
- **Retail/Franchise:** Fast-growing chains with 100-500 locations (Floor & Decor, Five Below)
- **Corporate:** Multi-location businesses with distributed IT needs (Credit Acceptance, UniFirst)

**Key Selection Criteria:**
✅ 10-300 locations (not so small you can't scale, not so big they have massive internal IT teams)
✅ Active expansion (new locations = need for field services)
✅ Recent funding or M&A activity (budget + urgency)
✅ Industries aligned with your experience (hospitality, healthcare, education)

## Why These Companies Need You

**Field Services:**
- Companies like **First Watch** (530+ restaurants) and **Five Below** (1,500+ stores) are opening 50-150 new locations per year
- Each new location = network buildout, POS installation, cabling—exactly what you do

**IT Relocation:**
- **Big Lots** (1,300 stores restructuring), **Credit Acceptance** (400 branches), **American Tire Distributors** (140 DCs)
- These companies are constantly relocating/consolidating—need experienced partners for tech moves

**IT Staffing:**
- **Village Medical** (600+ clinics), **Premise Health** (800+ workplace health centers), **Carbon Health** (130+ urgent care)
- Rapid expansion = staffing gaps, need reliable W-2 techs on demand

## Buying Triggers to Monitor

I've included specific signals to watch for each company:
- New location announcements
- Office relocations (real estate transactions)
- Funding rounds
- M&A activity (acquisitions = IT integration projects)
- Technology upgrade announcements

## Suggested Next Steps

**Option 1: High-Volume Outbound**
- Enrich these 25 accounts in Clay (get decision-maker contacts)
- Launch targeted email campaigns using the messaging angles I provided
- Goal: 5-10 qualified conversations in next 30 days

**Option 2: ABM Approach**
- Pick top 10 accounts (I'd suggest: Hyatt Place, First Watch, Carbon Health, Village Medical, Floor & Decor, Five Below, Charter Schools USA, Grand Canyon University, Credit Acceptance, UniFirst)
- Multi-touch campaign: Email + LinkedIn + direct mail
- Research buying triggers (new locations, job postings, news)

**Option 3: We Can Help Execute**
- If you'd rather focus on closing deals than building lists and running campaigns, we can handle the outbound motion
- We'd build the full database, write the sequences, launch campaigns, and hand you qualified meetings
- Happy to discuss if that's interesting

## Sample Messaging

I've included 3 email templates in the research doc:
1. **Multi-location pain point:** "Managing IT across [X] locations?"
2. **Relocation support:** "Relocating soon? Here's what goes wrong..."
3. **IT staffing gaps:** "Short on IT staff right now?"

Feel free to use as-is or adapt to your voice.

Let me know if you want me to:
- Expand this to 50-100 accounts
- Focus on a specific industry (e.g., just healthcare or just hospitality)
- Help execute the outbound campaigns

Happy to jump on a quick call if you want to walk through the list.

Best,
Scott Davidson

## Notes for You

**Tone:** Professional but casual (not overly formal)

**Attachments to include:**
1. `supporttech-leads-25.csv` (for CRM import)
2. `supporttech-leads-25.md` (rename to PDF or just send as markdown/doc)

**Follow-up timing:**
- If no response in 3 days: "Just wanted to make sure you got the lead list—any questions?"
- If no response in 7 days: "Curious if any of these companies jumped out as interesting. Happy to help prioritize or expand the list."

**If they ask about pricing for execution:**
- Reference your standard engagement ($5K-$6K/month for outbound execution)
- Offer a pilot: "We could start with 10 accounts, run for 60 days, see if we get 3-5 qualified meetings"
