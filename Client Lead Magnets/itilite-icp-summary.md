## Anti-ICP (Who NOT to Target)

❌ **Companies with <40 employees**
- Reason: Below minimum travel threshold ($5K/month)
- Exception: Series A startups with rapid growth plans

❌ **Fully Remote Companies with No Travel**
- Reason: No travel = no need for travel management
- Exception: Remote companies doing team offsites 2+ times/year

❌ **Companies with <$5K Monthly Travel Spend**
- Reason: Below ITILITE's economic threshold
- ROI doesn't justify platform investment

❌ **Companies Happy with Current T&E System**
- Reason: No pain = no urgency to switch
- Exception: If current vendor is Concur/SAP (notorious for poor UX)

❌ **Early-Stage Startups (<50 Employees, Pre-Series A)**
- Reason: Limited budget, low travel volume
- Will likely self-manage with credit cards + Expensify

❌ **Industries with Minimal Travel**
- Manufacturing with local operations only
- Retail/e-commerce with warehouse-based teams
- Pure-play digital/remote SaaS with no field presence
