## Call Structure (Recommended)

### 1. Show Him the MDF Business Case (10 min)
**What to say:**
"Alright, so here's what we put together. This is a full business case you can present to Peplink, AT&T, Verizon—anyone with MDF funds. It's got the ICP, GTM approach, budget breakdown, expected ROI, everything they'll need to justify cutting you a check for $25K-$50K."

**Walk through:**
- Target: SMB service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, construction)
- Approach: Cold email + LinkedIn outbound
- Expected results: 10-20 deals/month by Month 6
- ROI: 2-6X return on their investment
- Sample messaging (show him the email examples)

**Key point:**
"This is vendor-agnostic, so you can shop it to multiple OEMs at once. Whoever says yes first, you run with them. And we'll provide any additional slides or data they request."

---

### 2. Explain What You'll Do (10 min)
**What to say:**
"So here's what we'd actually deliver if you want to move forward with us executing this..."

**Month 1: Foundation**
- Finalize ICP (which verticals to target first)
- Build 10,000-account database in Clay
- Write email sequences and LinkedIn messaging
- Set up HubSpot deal stages and tracking

**Months 2-3: Launch & Test**
- Send 500-1,000 emails/week (start lean, scale up)
- Launch LinkedIn outreach
- Track what's working, optimize messaging
- Goal: 10-15 qualified calls/month, 2-5 deals/month by Month 3

**Months 4-6: Scale (if MDF approved)**
- Ramp up to 2,000 emails/week
- Expand verticals
- Add trigger-based prospecting
- Goal: 30-50 calls/month, 10-20 deals/month

**Key point:**
"We're not just giving you a strategy doc and disappearing. We build it, run it with you, and prove it works before you bring it in-house or hire someone."

---

### 3. Present Pricing (5 min)
**What to say:**
"For pricing, we're recommending $5,500/month on a month-to-month basis after a 3-month minimum. Here's why..."

**Option 1: $5,500/month retainer (Recommended)**
- 3-month minimum (Jan-Mar)
- Includes: Strategy, execution, analytics, reporting
- Tools extra: ~$400-$700/month (Clay, email sender)
- Month-to-month after Month 3 (not locked into 12 months)

**Option 2: $15K project + $3K/month ongoing (Alternative)**
- $15K covers Months 1-3 buildout + execution
- $3K/month after that for ongoing campaigns
- Better if you prefer one-time expense vs recurring

**Key point:**
"You're basically getting a fractional GTM team—strategy, execution, and analytics—for less than hiring one full-time person. And if MDF comes through, vendors are funding this, not you."

---

### 4. Address Likely Objections (Be Ready)

**"$5,500/month feels steep"**
→ "Compare to hiring someone full-time at $80K/year plus benefits. This is two of us, no ramp time, cancel after Month 3 if it's not working. And if you get MDF, you're not even paying for it—vendors are."

**"Can I just take the MDF case and do this myself?"**
→ "Absolutely, you can. The business case is yours regardless. But most business owners don't have 20-40 hours/month to build lists, write copy, manage campaigns, and track results. That's what the retainer covers. And vendors will ask for proof you're executing—we provide that."

**"What if MDF doesn't come through?"**
→ "Then we scale down. Months 1-3 are lean anyway (500-1,000 emails/week). If no MDF by Month 3, we either continue at reduced scope ($3K-$4K/month) or pause. You're not locked in."

**"I need to talk to my partners first"**
→ "Totally understand. Take the MDF case, shop it to vendors this week, see what they say. If they're interested, we're here to execute. If not, no hard feelings."

## Decision Points (What You Need from Him)

### ✅ Does he want to move forward with the retainer?
- **YES → Send SOW, kickoff week of Jan 20**
- **NO → He takes MDF case, shops it himself, revisits later**
- **MAYBE → Follow up in 1-2 weeks after he talks to partners/vendors**

### ✅ Which pricing option?
- **Option 1: $5,500/month retainer (month-to-month after 3 months)**
- **Option 2: $15K project + $3K/month ongoing**

### ✅ When does he want to start?
- **Immediately (week of Jan 20) → Kickoff call, HubSpot access**
- **After MDF approval (Feb/Mar) → Check in after he shops the case**

## Red Flags to Watch For

❌ **"Let me think about it and get back to you in a few months"** = Not urgent, will ghost
→ Response: "No problem. Just FYI, if AT&T is ramping up and you want to show proof of direct motion by March, we'd need to start by end of January. But totally your call."

❌ **"Can you do this for $2K/month?"** = Budget mismatch
→ Response: "We could do advisory-only at $2-3K where we guide you but you execute. But the value is in us doing it—list building, campaigns, tracking. That's where the 40-60 hours/month goes."

❌ **"We're going to hire someone full-time instead"** = Timeline mismatch
→ Response: "Love it. Hiring takes 3-6 months. We can get you results in 3 months, then hand off a proven playbook to your new hire. De-risks the hire."

---

## Green Flags to Listen For

✅ **"When can we start?"** = Ready to go
✅ **"What do you need from me?"** = Engaged, wants to move forward
✅ **"I'm meeting with Peplink next week"** = MDF unlock is real
✅ **"My partners are going to love this"** = Internal buy-in
✅ **"Can we do 6 months instead of 3?"** = Serious commitment

## Call Closing (Last 5 min)

### If YES:
"Awesome. Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send you a simple 2-page SOW by Friday
2. We kick off week of Jan 20 (you give us HubSpot access, brand assets, product details)
3. Month 1 we build the foundation (ICP, lists, copy, CRM setup)
4. Month 2 we launch campaigns (500 emails/week to start)
5. You shop the MDF case to vendors while we're executing

Sound good?"

### If MAYBE:
"No pressure. Take the MDF business case, shop it to Peplink and AT&T this week. See what they say. If they're interested and want proof you have execution capability, ping me and we'll get started. Otherwise, totally fine—the case is yours to use however you want."

### If NO:
"All good, man. Appreciate the conversation. You've got the MDF case—go unlock that free money. And if you change your mind down the road, we're here. Good luck with the AT&T launch on Monday!"
