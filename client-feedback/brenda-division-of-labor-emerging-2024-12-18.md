# POSITIVE Development: Division of Labor IS Emerging

**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Context:** Post-Marcos call, Scott and Brenda working through partnership structure
**Status:** Potentially workable partnership model

---

## The Key Shift

### What Brenda USED to Say (Pre-Dec 18)
- "I only want to partner on demand generation"
- "Clay is just another tool I need to learn"

### What Brenda NOW Proposes (Dec 18 Conversation)
> **"If you're telling me on the technical side, I got us covered. You need to sell.**
>
> Then I kind of start structuring everything, doing... the go to market, the strategy... **I will develop that playbook**... what type of questions we need to be asking, what type of bare minimums we need... and then put that like in a systematic way."

**This is a MUCH better division of labor.**

---

## The Proposed Division

### Scott's Role: Technical/Systems

**Responsibilities:**
- Clay workflow design and implementation
- Technical infrastructure setup
- System architecture
- Workflow iteration and optimization
- "The Engine"

**Why this fits Scott:**
- Currently in Clay bootcamp building expertise
- Enjoys technical problem-solving
- FP&A background (systems thinking)
- Can connect to financial outcomes

### Brenda's Role: GTM Strategy/Packaging

**Responsibilities:**
- ICP definition and research
- Discovery call methodology and questionnaires
- Sales playbook development
- Proposal development and packaging
- Client prep and strategic positioning
- "Productization" - turning systems into sellable offerings

**Brenda's own words:**
> "If we were engaged since the beginning... what I could have done differently is **prep for the different calls**, I have a questionnaire like these are the different types of questions... all that playbook on **requesting data, preparing better, having a nice proposal. Focusing on closing the customer**...
>
> You designed the system... but then **I package all of that into: This is a product.**"

**Why this fits Brenda:**
- Georgetown MBA (strategic thinking)
- PE portfolio experience (knows what clients need)
- Strong on positioning and packaging
- Sales methodology background

### Both: Selling Together

- Co-selling to clients
- Joint client engagement
- Strategic decisions together

---

## Why This Could Be 1+1=3

### Scott's Core Concern (From Transcript)

> "Both of us setting up DemandGen... I don't think the execution of it requires multiple people. Because... it'd be like **1 + 1 equals 2.**
>
> Whereas... **if you handle sales and I handle ops**... I see it as more like **multiplicative, like 1 + 1 equals 3.**"

### This New Division Addresses That

**NOT overlapping:**
- ❌ Both doing Clay execution (1+1=2)
- ❌ Both learning same technical skills (duplication)

**Complementary:**
- ✅ Scott builds systems Brenda couldn't build
- ✅ Brenda packages/positions in ways Scott wouldn't
- ✅ Together = complete offering (strategy + execution)

**Example: Marcos/Treasury Hub**

**Without Brenda:**
- Scott builds Clay system
- Scott creates proposal
- Scott does discovery methodology
- Result: Takes longer, less polished

**With Brenda:**
- Scott builds Clay system (his strength)
- Brenda creates discovery questionnaire, preps calls, packages proposal (her strength)
- Result: Faster, more professional, better client experience

**That's 1+1=3.**

## On Learning Clay: The Right Approach

### Brenda's Commitment

> "I need to understand, like really well what's feasible. And then with that I can just go with it. **And that is not on you**, you know, like **I can do it on my own time**... you can share with me some materials or some examples."

**Why this matters:**
- She's NOT asking Scott to teach her Clay
- She's NOT trying to become a Clay expert herself
- She's learning ENOUGH to inform her strategy work
- She's doing it on her own time

**This is the right level of knowledge for her role:**
- Understand what's possible (to sell it)
- Understand constraints (to set expectations)
- Understand effort level (to price properly)
- NOT: Become a Clay execution expert

**Analogy:** A product manager doesn't need to code, but needs to understand engineering constraints.

---

## Target Market Alignment

### Strong Agreement On

1. **PE/VC/Family Offices** (Brenda's preference)
   - Network effect
   - Portfolio companies = built-in pipeline
   - High-value, repeatable

2. **Companies Entering US Market** (Both see demand)
   - European companies (Brenda has seen multiple)
   - LatAm companies expanding north
   - Real, validated segment

3. **Finance Software/Office of CFO** (Scott's differentiation)
   - Scott's FP&A background = speaks their language
   - Vertical specialization

**Geographic focus:** US, NY, DC-based

**This alignment is strong.**

---

## Service Structure Taking Shape

### Tiered Model Agreement

**Scott:** "DIY, Done with you, and done for you."
**Brenda:** Agrees, proposes segmentation by client type (solopreneurs vs. scale-ups)

### Client Segmentation

**Solopreneurs (like Marcos):**
- Build the system, teach them to run it
- Lower price point, less hand-holding

**Scale-ups:**
- More strategy support
- Higher touch
- Different questionnaire/requirements

### Key Question They're Asking

**Do we even want clients without a defined ICP?**

This shows:
- Thoughtful about client qualification
- Not desperate for any client
- Want to serve clients they can actually help

**Smart positioning.**

---

## What Makes This Workable

### 1. Honest About Uncertainty

**Brenda (multiple times):**
> "We don't know what we don't know... we'll need to discover together."

**Scott:** Agrees

**Why this is good:**
- Not over-promising to each other
- Willing to test and iterate
- Realistic expectations

### 2. Willing to Test Hypotheses

**Brenda:** "I think that right now it's like a lot of hypothesis on how we're going to work together."
**Scott:** "I think we're at the point where we test."

**Approach:**
- First 10 clients from referrals
- Define offering, pricing, packaging
- Test and learn
- Iterate based on results

**This is smart** - not betting the farm, testing assumptions.

### 3. Complementary Strengths Acknowledged

**Brenda on Scott's value:**
> "You're senior enough to cut through the noise... **you connect that to finance. Which is like the most powerful thing**... **you're tied up with forecasting and with the numbers is the value** there."

**They agree on combined strength:**
> **Brenda:** "We can see strategy, but also we can implement systems."
> **Scott:** "Yes." (agrees)

They recognize what each brings AND what they deliver together.

### 4. Not a Referral Relationship

When Scott asked directly: "Is this a referral relationship or a partnership?"

**Brenda's answer:**
> "I don't see it as a referral... **I see it like we get involved together.**"

She wants a real partnership, not just cross-referrals.

---

## What Still Needs Clarity (For Friday)

Despite progress, these remain:

1. **Revenue split** - How do they divide income?
2. **Legal structure** - Partnership LLC? Equity split?
3. **Time commitment** - Hours per week each person?
4. **Decision-making** - Who decides what?
5. **Exit scenarios** - What if one wants out?

---

## For Friday's Partnership Meeting

### Evidence to Reference

**Positive developments from this conversation:**
- ✅ Division of labor emerging (systems vs. strategy)
- ✅ Brenda will learn Clay "on her own time" (not expecting you to teach)
- ✅ Target market aligned (PE/VC/FO + companies entering US)
- ✅ Service structure taking shape (DIY/DWY/DFY)
- ✅ Both honest about uncertainty, willing to test
- ✅ Brenda says "not a referral relationship, we work together"

### Questions to Ask

1. **"So to be clear: You'd focus on GTM strategy, ICP, sales methodology, packaging. I'd focus on Clay systems and technical implementation. Both of us sell together. Is that the division you're proposing?"**

2. **"How do we split revenue? 50/50? Based on who brought the client? Based on who does more work?"**

3. **"What's your time commitment? I'm in this full-time. Are you thinking 10 hrs/week, 20 hrs/week, full-time eventually?"**

4. **"If we do this, what's the legal structure? Partnership LLC? How do we handle equity?"**

5. **"What happens if one of us wants to exit in 6 months, 12 months, 2 years?"**

### Decision Framework

**Partnership makes sense if:**
- ✅ Clear division of labor (systems vs. strategy) - **EMERGING**
- ✅ Target market alignment - **YES**
- ✅ Complementary skills (1+1=3) - **POTENTIALLY**
- ✅ Similar time commitment - **TBD**
- ✅ Agreeable revenue split - **TBD**
- ✅ Legal structure makes sense - **TBD**

**3 out of 6 = progress, but not done yet.**

---

## Bottom Line

**This conversation shows the partnership COULD work.**

**The division emerging:**
- Scott = Systems/Technical (Clay, workflows, implementation)
- Brenda = Strategy/GTM (ICP, sales methodology, packaging, productization)
- Both = Selling together

**This addresses Scott's 1+1=3 concern** because it's complementary, not overlapping.

**BUT:** Still need clarity on revenue split, time commitment, legal structure.

**Friday's meeting should focus on:**
1. Confirming this division of labor
2. Clarifying the structural questions (revenue, time, legal)
3. Deciding: Go or no-go

**Unlike earlier conversations, this one shows real potential for alignment.**
