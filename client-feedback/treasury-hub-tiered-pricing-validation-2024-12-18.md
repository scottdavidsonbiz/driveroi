# Treasury Hub Validates Tiered Pricing + Pilot Engagement Model

**Date:** December 18, 2024
**Client:** Marcos Barrabés, Treasury Hub
**Status:** International fintech, $20K ACV, Mexico/Ghana focus

---

## The Key Insight

**Marcos explicitly requested tiered pricing options instead of single price:**

> "Please share that with me... like **three different plans**... for this budget, this is what we can do; for this other budget, this is what we can do. Building plus execution, or just building... just for me to understand what's covered in terms of deliverables."

**This validates the need for:**
1. Multiple pricing tiers (not one-size-fits-all)
2. Clear build vs. execution split at each tier
3. Specific deliverables outlined for each price point
4. Pilot approach (3 months) before full commitment

---

## What Marcos Wants (In His Words)

### Not Consumable Products

> "I was not expecting two products that get consumed within a few days... what I really need is to **build a system first and then execute it.**"

**Translation:**
- Doesn't want one-off deliverables (like lead magnets)
- Wants infrastructure + ongoing optimization
- Values system-building over quick wins
- **This validates "Build → Run → Prove → Handoff" positioning**

### Tiered Options for Budget Flexibility

> "I understand that budget might be too low for you... please share... **two different plans or three different plans**... for this budget, this is what we can do."

**Translation:**
- Knows his budget might be constraining
- Wants to SEE options at different price points
- Willing to pay more if value is clear
- Wants to choose his own engagement level

### Specific Clay Deliverables

> "If you can be specific in terms of... **with Clay you can do anything**... what you're particularly thinking of in terms of the first few months, the basics, and then how you see it evolving."

**Translation:**
- Doesn't want vague "we'll use Clay" promises
- Wants concrete deliverables (which tables, enrichments, workflows)
- Wants to understand evolution path (Month 1 vs. Month 3 vs. Month 6)
- Needs specificity to evaluate value

### Pilot Before Full Commitment

**Brenda's question opened this:**
> "Let's say we run a pilot with you for the next three months... we build the system but also in the next three months let's run the pilot based on your preferences."

**Marcos's response:**
- Prioritize NetSuite ERP users (technographic filter)
- Focus on Mexico and Ghana (geographic specificity)
- Start January/early February
- Test before committing to larger engagement

---

## What This Changes

### 1. Need Tiered Pricing Model (Not Single Price)

**OLD APPROACH:**
- "Here's our price: $6K-$12K/month"
- Client either accepts or declines
- Lose clients due to budget constraints

**NEW APPROACH (Validated by Marcos):**
- **Tier 1:** Guided Build (~$2K-3K/month, 10 hrs, client does execution)
- **Tier 2:** Full Build + Execution ($4K-5K/month, end-to-end delivery)
- **Tier 3:** Premium Partnership ($6K-12K/month, multiple ICPs + ongoing optimization)

**Benefits:**
- Doesn't lose clients due to budget
- Client chooses engagement level
- Can upsell Tier 1 → Tier 2 after proving value
- International clients can access lower tier

### 2. "Build vs. Execution" Split Must Be Explicit

**What Marcos wants clarity on:**
- At $2K/month: What do YOU do vs. what do I do?
- At $5K/month: What do YOU do vs. what do I do?
- At $10K/month: What do YOU do vs. what do I do?

**Template for Each Tier:**

**TIER 1: Guided Build**
- **You do:** Strategy, framework setup, documentation, async Q&A, recommendations
- **Client does:** Actual execution, copywriting, domain setup, campaign implementation

**TIER 2: Full Build + Execution**
- **You do:** Strategy + ALL execution (Clay, Instantly, domains, copy, testing)
- **Client does:** Provide feedback, review results, strategic decisions

**TIER 3: Premium Partnership**
- **You do:** Everything in Tier 2 + ongoing optimization + multiple ICP hypotheses + analytics
- **Client does:** Provide strategic direction, approve approaches

### 3. Pilot Engagement Model (3 Months → Scale)

**Structure:**
- **Pilot:** 3 months, ONE ICP hypothesis (e.g., NetSuite + Mexico/Ghana)
- **Goal:** Prove the system works (X meetings/month, Y pipeline value)
- **Decision point:** Month 3 - continue with expanded scope or adjust
- **Scale:** Add additional hypotheses (new geographies, new technographics)

**Benefits:**
- De-risks for client (3-month test vs. 12-month commitment)
- De-risks for you (validate they'll act on meetings before investing heavily)
- Builds trust before expanding
- Natural upsell path (pilot → full engagement)

### 4. Hypothesis-Testing Approach for ICP Validation

**Scott's framing (from transcript):**
> "Each set of campaigns is testing a hypothesis... NetSuite in Nigeria and Mexico... then go to the next hypothesis, which might be they have Sage Intacct and they're in Kenya."

**Structure:**
- **Hypothesis 1:** NetSuite + Mexico/Ghana (3 months)
- **Hypothesis 2:** Sage Intacct + Kenya (next 3 months)
- **Hypothesis 3:** [Based on learnings from H1 and H2]

**Each hypothesis = Clay table + campaigns + testing**

**Benefits:**
- Focused testing vs. spray-and-pray across all segments
- Learn what works before scaling
- Easy to scope/price (one hypothesis = X hours)
- Client sees methodical approach

---

## Specific ICP Details (Treasury Hub)

### Technographic Filter
- **Primary:** Companies using NetSuite ERP
- **Secondary (future):** Sage Intacct, other mid-market ERPs

**Why this matters:**
- Treasury/cash management software integrates with ERP
- NetSuite = mid-market companies (fits $20K ACV)
- Strong buying signal (companies investing in finance infrastructure)
- Can be filtered in Clay via technographic enrichment

### Geographic Focus
- **Pilot:** Mexico and Ghana
- **Reasoning:** Treasury Hub's current expansion markets
- **Future:** Could expand to other LatAm/Africa countries after validation

### Pricing
- **Average ACV:** $20K/year
- **Variation:** Mexico slightly higher, West Africa potentially lower
- **Model:** Annual contracts

### Timeline
- **Target start:** January 2025
- **Realistic:** Jan 12-26 (post-holiday)
- **Pilot duration:** 3 months
- **Decision point:** End of Q1 2025

## Key Quotes

**On wanting system, not products:**
> "I was not expecting two products that get consumed within a few days... what I really need is to build a system first and then execute it."

**On tiered pricing:**
> "Please share... two different plans or three different plans... Building plus execution, or just building."

**On Clay specifics:**
> "If you can be in the... especially with the Clay part... what you will include... with Clay you can do anything... the first few months the basics and then how you see it evolving."

**On budget constraints:**
> "I understand that budget might be too low for you... let me go through it... for this budget, this is what we can do; for this other budget, this is what we can do."

## Patterns Validated

### 1. International Clients Have Budget Constraints
- Treasury Hub (Spain → LatAm/Africa): Budget-sensitive
- Marcos (Spain): Wanted $2K/month initially
- **Pattern:** International clients want expertise at non-US pricing

### 2. Clients Want Build → Run → Prove
- Marcos explicitly said: "build a system first and then execute it"
- Doesn't want consumable deliverables
- Wants ongoing partnership
- **Validates core positioning model**

### 3. Tiered Pricing Increases Conversion
- Instead of losing client due to budget → offer lower tier
- Client can choose engagement level
- Natural upsell path after proving value
- **Makes service accessible to more clients**

### 4. Pilot Reduces Risk for Both Sides
- 3-month test before full commitment
- Focused on one hypothesis (provable results)
- Builds trust before expanding scope
- **Smart for new client relationships**

## What to Create Next

### 1. Tiered Pricing Framework Document
**File:** `positioning/tiered-pricing-framework-2024-12-18.md`

**Contents:**
- Three tiers defined
- Build vs. execution split for each
- Pricing rationale
- When to use each tier
- Upsell path (Tier 1 → 2 → 3)

### 2. Pilot Engagement Framework
**File:** `positioning/pilot-engagement-framework-2024-12-18.md`

**Contents:**
- 3-month structure
- Hypothesis-testing approach
- Success metrics for pilot
- Decision criteria for scaling
- Pilot → full engagement transition

### 3. Update Dec 16 Positioning Doc
**Updates needed:**
- Add tiered pricing model
- Add pilot engagement option
- Adjust international client pricing
- Refine Tier 1 (US Market Entry) to show guided vs. full build options

---

## Bottom Line

**Marcos validated four critical things:**

1. **Build → Run → Prove → Handoff model is what clients want** (not consumable deliverables)
2. **Tiered pricing solves budget objections** (offer options, don't lose clients on price)
3. **Specificity matters** (don't be vague about Clay deliverables, show exact workflows)
4. **Pilot approach de-risks** (3 months to prove before full commitment)

**This is actionable market feedback that should shape your service model going forward.**
