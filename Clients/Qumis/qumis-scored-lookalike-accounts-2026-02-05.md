# Qumis: 24 High-Fit Accounts Your Team Can Target This Week

**Prepared by DriveROI | Scott Davidson | scott@driveroi.com**

---

## How We Built This

We reverse-engineered your ICP from 7 known Qumis customers: Kapnick Insurance, Skyward Specialty, NFP, Brown & Brown, CRC Group, Cottingham & Butler, and Coterie Insurance.

Instead of guessing who to call, we analyzed what your best customers have in common, built a scoring model around those patterns, and identified 24 companies that match.

---

## Your ICP Pattern (Based on Existing Customers)

We found 5 signals that predict Qumis fit:

| Signal | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **Specialty/complex risk focus** | Complex policies need AI analysis. Standard commercial doesn't. |
| **Scale ($100M+ rev or 250+ employees)** | Volume creates the bottleneck Qumis solves. |
| **Growth-oriented (acquisitive, PE/VC-backed)** | Acquirers inherit policy portfolios overnight. Manual review breaks. |
| **Technology-forward** | They buy tools. They have budget. They'll evaluate, not ignore. |
| **Multi-line or multi-segment** | More policy types = more complexity = more value from Qumis. |

Your customer base spans the entire value chain: retail brokers, wholesale/E&S, carriers, and MGAs. The unifying need isn't the business model. It's policy complexity at volume.

## Scoring Model (100 Points)

| Factor | Points | What We Measured |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Specialty/E&S Focus | 25 | Does the company handle specialty, E&S, or complex risk? |
| Scale | 20 | Revenue and employee count relative to your customer base |
| Growth Trajectory | 20 | Acquisitive, PE/VC-backed, or publicly traded with growth pressure |
| Technology Adoption | 15 | Invests in platforms, has tech team, or is tech-native |
| Multi-Segment Complexity | 10 | Operates across multiple insurance verticals or business lines |
| No Known Competitor | 10 | Not publicly using a competing policy analysis platform |

**Tier A: 75-100** (high fit, ready to target)
**Tier B: 60-74** (good fit, worth pursuing)
**Tier C: 50-59** (moderate fit, nurture)

## Why These Companies, Not Others

**We filtered out:**
- Personal lines carriers (no policy complexity)
- Small local agencies (<50 employees, no volume)
- Standard commercial-only brokers (no specialty exposure)
- Companies publicly using competing policy analysis tools

**We prioritized:**
- Companies actively acquiring (they inherit policy portfolios and need to review them fast)
- Wholesale/E&S specialists (every placement involves complex policy language)
- Publicly traded companies (growth pressure = budget for efficiency tools)
- PE/VC-backed platforms (investors demand operational efficiency)

## Sample Outreach: Amwins (Score: 95)

**Subject:** 5,871 employees reviewing specialty policies manually?

Hi [Name],

Amwins places more wholesale specialty premium than anyone in the country. That volume means your team is reviewing hundreds of complex E&S policies every week, comparing coverage terms, and catching exclusions that could cost millions.

Qumis automates that analysis with attorney-level precision. Your brokers spend less time reading policies and more time placing business.

Five of the top 15 U.S. brokers already use Qumis. Worth a 15-minute look?

---

## Sample Outreach: Markel Group (Score: 90)

**Subject:** 50% specialty casualty, how fast is your policy review?

Hi [Name],

Markel underwrites some of the most complex specialty casualty and E&S business in the market. With $16B+ in revenue and 30+ lines, your underwriting teams are reading dense policy forms all day.

Qumis reads policies like an insurance attorney and surfaces differences, exclusions, and coverage gaps in minutes instead of hours. Built by coverage lawyers, used by 5 of the top 15 brokers.

Happy to show you what it looks like on a Markel policy.

## What This Would Look Like at Scale

This scored list was built manually using public data. Here's what an automated version looks like:

**Clay Workflow (30 minutes/week to maintain):**
1. Source companies from insurance industry databases (AM Best, NAIC, InsurTech Connect)
2. Enrich with firmographic data (employee count, revenue, specialty lines)
3. Score automatically using the 100-point model above
4. Detect triggers: acquisitions announced, PE investments, new specialty lines launched, hiring signals (underwriting roles, policy analyst roles)
5. Route Tier A accounts to CRM with personalized outreach templates
6. Refresh monthly as new companies enter the market or existing ones grow

**What you'd get:**
- 200+ scored accounts refreshed monthly
- Trigger alerts when a Tier A account acquires a new book of business
- Contact enrichment (VP Underwriting, Head of Operations, CTO)
- Personalized outreach referencing their specific specialty lines and volume
