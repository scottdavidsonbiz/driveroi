**IVS Contracts Analysis**

**Important:** 

* Can you send marketing and sales materials/decks?  
* Any 2026 targets or expansions we should know about? (new offerings, new ICP targeting, new/relevant law updates, etc)  
  * Here’s some of the new law changes in effect.  
  * 

| State | Key 2025 Change | Filing Impact |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Texas** | $125,000 BPP Exemption | Eliminates tax for 90% of small businesses; per-location relief. |
| **Florida** | Lease Tax Repeal | Significant cash flow improvement for commercial tenants. |
| **Washington** | Farm/Social Exemptions | Protects "Agricultural" status for diversified farm use. |
| **IN / AZ / WY** | De Minimis Increases | Higher thresholds mean fewer assets are actually taxable. |
| **Federal** | 100% Bonus Depreciation | Impacts the "book vs. tax" gap and asset lifecycle strategy. |

  * Some of the companies we have been targeting are Clearwater Paper, Ablemarle, Daikin, Synesqo, Blue Bell, DNow   
* How are we leveraging ZoomInfo today? Just for intent?  
  * Mostly just for intent and finding contact information for individuals to contact  
* Can you help us understand the sales process on a handful of recent closed won opportunities?   
  * Who was the buyer persona? Mostly the Property Tax Manager or Directors.  Normally they have to get buyin from their CFO or VP of indirect tax prior to signing a contract.  
    * Type of company? Small and medium businesses.  The oil and gas services industry, Industrials, Waste Management, and Biorefining have been our most recent signings.  
  * Outbound/Inbound?  
    * About half and half. Many were outbound, but a few inbound with referrals due to having connections with properties or companies we already represented.  
  * Referral?  
    * 2 were referrals.  Lone Star Grease & Lubricants was a referral from a contact at Daikin.  We were trying to leverage them to get in the door with Daikin and set up a larger contract.  Energy Solutions was a referral from Clean Harbors as they had property next door that also received massive increase in real property valuation  
  * Facility locations?  
    * Mostly Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska  
* You will see below Brenda mention the concentration of companies with HQ in TX. Is that a priority? Or accounts with facilities in TX?   
  * It is easier to set up meetings with companies in Texas, but not a necessity  
* Do you have a hypothesis or desire for a few high dollar accounts vs. more low dollar accounts.  
  * While we would love a few high dollar accounts, I am more interested in accounts that we can make long term clients.  
* Get guidance on:   
  * Clean Harbors shared accounts: Which entities are off-limits vs. fair game?  
    * Not sure what this question is asking  
  * Inventory scope: Kickoff notes mention "inventory excluded". Make sure this is clear in messaging to avoid scope confusion.  
    * I believe this is regarding our contingency billing.  We exclude inventory fluctuations in items we would bill for if the inventory value is lower than the prior year.  The only things we bill for regarding inventory is if we receive an exemption that was not previously in place, or we are able to identify reductions in reporting costs through a thorough analysis into the company’s standardized cost.

For DriveROI:

* Add Contracts to the suppression list.

## **Summary**

IVS has 51 active contracts generating $1.69M in annual flat-fee revenue. The client base is mature (12.7 years average tenure) and concentrated. A small number of bigger accounts drive most of the business.

# **Contract Data Analysis**

## **Revenue is Highly Concentrated**

A handful of large accounts generate the majority of revenue:

* **Top 5 clients** generate $1.1M, which is **65% of total revenue**  
* **Top 10 clients** generate $1.31M, which is **78% of total revenue**  
* **12 accounts billing \>$30K/year** generate **82% of total revenue**  
* **18 accounts billing \<$10K/year** generate only **4.4% of total revenue**

**What this means:** Prioritize quality over quantity. Great targeting/signals will be key.  
Tier 1 (LinkedIn outbound) should focus exclusively on whale-potential accounts.   
Don't waste high-touch effort on accounts that would be \<$10K deals.

## **Three Industries Drive 75% of Revenue**

| Industry | Revenue | \# Clients | Avg Fee |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Oil & Gas | $557K | 11 | $50,655 |
| Environmental Services | $486K | 2 | $243,000 |
| Chemical Manufacturing | $226K | 15 | $15,067 |

These three industries account for $1.27M of $1.69M total.

**Other industries present but smaller:** Mining ($71K), Food & Beverage ($120K from 1 client), Transportation/Logistics ($48K).

**What this means:**

* Oil & Gas \= highest total revenue, good avg fee  
* Environmental Services \= massive avg fee but only 2 clients (Clean Harbors family)—find lookalikes here  
* Chemical Manufacturing \= most clients but lower avg fee—good for email volume play

## **1,000+ Employees is the Sweet Spot**

| Company Size | Revenue | \# Clients | Avg Fee |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 10,001+ employees | $520K | 7 | $74,286 |
| 5,001-10,000 employees | $448K | 8 | $55,938 |
| 1,001-5,000 employees | $385K | 10 | $38,460 |
| 501-1,000 employees | $52K | 3 | $17,333 |
| 51-200 employees | $38K | 5 | $7,660 |
| 11-50 employees | $86K | 9 | $9,511 |

Companies with 1,000+ employees account for 25 clients and $1.35M revenue (80% of total).

**What this means:** Set 1,000 employees as the floor. 

The 1K-10K range offers the best balance between deal size and addressable market.

## **Texas is 44% of the Business**

* **15 Texas-based clients** \= $736K revenue (44% of total)  
* **Houston specifically** \= 6 clients  
* Other notable clusters: London HQ (5 clients—international companies with US operations)

**Priority states** (from kickoff—states that tax personal property): TX, OK, LA, AR, FL (primary); MT, NM (secondary); CA (slow cycle—treat as separate experiment).

**What this means:** Texas facility presence should be a high-weight filter.

## **Long Tenure \= Proof of Stickiness**

| Tenure | \# Clients | Revenue | % of Total |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 20+ years | 14 | $650K | 38.5% |
| 11-20 years | 10 | $517K | 30.6% |
| 6-10 years | 14 | $278K | 16.5% |
| 3-5 years | 8 | $107K | 6.3% |
| 0-2 years | 5 | $136K | 8.1% |

**69% of revenue comes from clients with 10+ year relationships.** Average tenure is 12.7 years, median is 9 years.

**What this means for messaging:** This is a credibility asset. IVS isn't a transactional vendor—they manage portfolios for decades. Use for messaging

## **Public Companies \= Majority \+ Signal Access**

* **Public companies:** 26 clients (51%)  
* **Private companies:** 15 clients

**What this means:** Public-company majority means 10-K filings signal property tax mentions, CapEx for expansions, and M\&A activity.

## **Fee Structure Supports Multiple Messaging Angles**

| Fee Model | \# Clients | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Flat fee only | 30 (59%) | Predictable budgeting |
| Contingency only | 8 (16%) | No upfront cost |
| Mixed (flat \+ contingency) | 12 (24%) | Hybrid approach |

Contingency rates when used: 20% (7 clients), 33.33% (7 clients), 15% (3 clients). Hourly rate: $350/hr.

**What this means:** Two messaging angles available—"predictable budget" (flat fee) vs. "no savings, no fee" (contingency).

## **Lookalike Seeds (High Fee \+ Long Tenure)**

These 9 clients have BOTH high fees (\>$20K/year) AND long tenure (10+ years). They represent the ideal customer profile:

| Client | Annual Fee | Tenure | Industry | Size |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| HF Sinclair | $387.5K | 18 yrs | Oil & Gas | 5K-10K |
| Clean Harbors | $303K | 22 yrs | Environmental | 10K+ |
| Safety-Kleen | $183K | 22 yrs | Environmental | 1K-5K |
| Koppers Industries | $41K | 26 yrs | Chemical Mfg | 1K-5K |
| Core Laboratories | $35K | 18 yrs | Oil & Gas | 1K-5K |
| Calumet Specialty | $32K | 13 yrs | Oil & Gas | 1K-5K |
| Tessenderlo Kerley | $32K | 25 yrs | Chemical Mfg | 500-1K |
| Calcasieu Refining | $30K | 13 yrs | Oil & Gas | 51-200 |
| Stolthaven | $24K | 24 yrs | Logistics | 5K-10K |

**Pattern:** Oil & Gas \+ Chemical Mfg in the 1K-5K employee range is where IVS has proven product-market fit.

## **Risk (or Opportunity) Flag**

Environmental Services generates $486K from just 2 clients (Clean Harbors and Safety-Kleen, both under the same parent company). That's 29% of revenue from one relationship. High concentration risk, but also signals that waste management/environmental could be a high-value vertical to expand.

# **GTM Strategy \+ Kickoff Inputs**

## **Decision Makers**

**Primary targets:**

* VP of Tax  
* Tax Director  
* Indirect Tax Manager

**Secondary targets (budget holders):**

* CFO  
* Controller

**Influencers:**

* Facility Manager  
* Plant Manager

---

## **Intent Signals to Track**

**High-Priority Signals:**

* New construction / facility expansion  
* M\&A / ownership changes  
* Plant closure or idling  
* New CFO, VP of Tax, Tax Director, or Controller (job change in last 90 days)  
* 10-K mentions of property tax issues (public companies)

**Medium-Priority Signals:**

* Expiring tax abatements  
* Valuation lawsuits  
* Industry cost-cutting initiatives  
* Revaluation year in their county

**Where to find signals:**

* LinkedIn (job changes, company updates)  
* SEC filings / 10-Ks (property tax keywords, CapEx)  
* Public records (property transfers, building permits)  
* News / press releases (M\&A, expansions, closures)

**Important:** Don't personalize with generic fluff. Use trigger \+ hypothesis: "Saw the expansion announcement—new facilities typically spike personal property assessments in Texas. Worth a 15-minute review?"

---

## **Offers**

**Primary Offer (Lead with this):** Free assessment review at one location to quantify potential tax savings. Low effort for prospect (just share documents), immediate value (quantified savings estimate), establishes credibility before commitment.

**Secondary Offer (Nurture track):** Customized property tax calendar with state-specific filing deadlines, appeal windows, and lien dates. High utility, low threat, keeps IVS top-of-mind.

**Tertiary Offer (Executive/compliance personas):** Legislative update memo covering new property tax law changes, legal cases, and depreciation table updates. Positions IVS as insider experts.
