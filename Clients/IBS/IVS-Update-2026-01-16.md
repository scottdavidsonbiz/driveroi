## Needs Your Input

### 1. Email Copy Review
We have draft sequences ready for your review. Looking for feedback on:
- Tone and voice - does this sound like IVS?
- Value prop positioning - are we hitting the right pain points?
- Any terminology or phrasing to avoid?

**[Link to email copy doc or screen share during meeting]**

### 2. Target Account List
Built a Clay table with ~100 target accounts scored by ICP fit. Want to walk you through:
- How we're scoring/tiering accounts
- Any accounts to prioritize or remove
- Companies you're already in conversations with (suppression)

**Questions:**
- Are there specific companies you want us to prioritize?
- Anyone we should avoid (existing relationships, competitors, etc.)?

### 3. BusinessWire Trigger Feed
Set up a Clay table connected to BusinessWire RSS for:
- Facility expansion announcements
- M&A activity
- Leadership changes

**Question:** Any other triggers we should monitor?
