# IVS (IBS Client) - ICP Targeting Criteria for Clay

**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026
**Purpose:** Translate contracts analysis into actionable Clay filters and targeting criteria

---

## Executive Summary

IVS has achieved $1.69M in annual revenue from 51 clients with 12.7 year average tenure. **The key insight: Quality over quantity.**

- Top 5 clients = 65% of revenue
- 1,000+ employee companies = 80% of revenue
- Three industries = 75% of revenue (Oil & Gas, Environmental Services, Chemical Mfg)
- Texas = 44% of revenue

**Core Strategy:** Focus on "whale-potential" accounts (1,000+ employees in target industries with Texas/priority state facilities) rather than volume.

## Intent Signals & Triggers

### High-Priority Signals (Worth Immediate Personalized Outreach)

#### 1. Facility Expansion / New Construction
**Where to Find:**
- Press releases (company website, PRNewswire, BusinessWire)
- LinkedIn company updates
- Local business journals
- Construction permits (public records)

**Why It Matters:** New facilities = new personal property assessments = immediate need for IVS

**Messaging Hook:**
"Saw the announcement about your new [City] facility. New construction typically triggers personal property assessments that spike 20-40% higher than actual market value in Texas. Worth a 15-minute review before the first assessment notice?"

**Clay Enrichment:**
- News mentions: "facility expansion" OR "new plant" OR "groundbreaking" OR "construction"
- Timeframe: Last 12 months

---

#### 2. M&A Activity / Ownership Changes
**Where to Find:**
- SEC filings (8-K for public companies)
- Press releases
- Business news
- LinkedIn company updates

**Why It Matters:** Ownership changes often trigger reassessments; new owners may not be aware of existing property tax exposures

**Messaging Hook:**
"Congrats on the [Company X] acquisition. Ownership changes often trigger county reassessments—especially on industrial equipment. Have you reviewed the personal property tax exposure on the acquired assets?"

**Clay Enrichment:**
- News mentions: "acquisition" OR "merger" OR "acquired" OR "closes deal"
- SEC filings: Recent 8-K filings
- Timeframe: Last 6 months

---

#### 3. New Tax Leadership (Job Changes)
**Where to Find:**
- LinkedIn job change notifications
- Company press releases
- ZoomInfo intent signals

**Target Roles:**
- CFO (new in role)
- VP of Tax (new in role)
- Tax Director (new in role)
- Controller (new in role)
- Indirect Tax Manager (new in role)

**Why It Matters:** New tax leaders often audit existing vendors and look for optimization opportunities

**Messaging Hook:**
"Saw you recently joined [Company] as [Title]. As you're evaluating the tax function, one area that often gets overlooked is personal property tax on industrial assets. We manage $[X] in personal property for [industry] companies—happy to provide a free assessment at one location to see if there's opportunity."

**Clay Enrichment:**
- Job change in last 90 days
- LinkedIn profile data

---

#### 4. 10-K Property Tax Mentions (Public Companies Only)
**Where to Find:**
- SEC EDGAR filings (10-K annual reports)
- Search for keywords: "property tax", "ad valorem", "personal property", "assessment", "valuation dispute"

**Why It Matters:** If they're mentioning property tax in 10-K, it's material enough to matter

**Messaging Hook:**
"I noticed [Company]'s 10-K mentions property tax exposure on industrial assets. We specialize in [industry] personal property valuations—26 years managing portfolios for companies like [similar client]. Worth a conversation?"

**Clay Enrichment:**
- 10-K text search for property tax keywords
- Public companies only

---

### Medium-Priority Signals (Good for Nurture/Email Sequences)

#### 5. Plant Closure or Idling
**Why It Matters:** Idle facilities are often over-assessed; opportunity to argue functional obsolescence

**Messaging Hook:**
"Saw the announcement about [Facility] idling. Idle industrial assets are often still assessed at full operating value—we've helped clients get 50-80% reductions by documenting functional obsolescence."

---

#### 6. Expiring Tax Abatements
**Why It Matters:** Companies that had abatements often get reassessed at full value when they expire

**Messaging Hook:**
"Your [City] facility's tax abatement is expiring in [Year]. Post-abatement reassessments often spike 3-5x. We can help you challenge the valuation before it becomes final."

---

#### 7. Industry Cost-Cutting Initiatives
**Why It Matters:** When industries announce belt-tightening, tax optimization becomes a priority

**Messaging Hook:**
"With [Industry] margins under pressure, property tax is often an overlooked cost reduction opportunity. We're saving clients 15-30% annually—happy to review one location to see if there's opportunity."

---

#### 8. Revaluation Year in County
**Why It Matters:** Counties conduct periodic revaluations (every 3-5 years typically); assessments often spike during revaluation years

**Messaging Hook:**
"[County] is in a revaluation year. Industrial assessments often spike 30-50% during revaluation cycles. We can help you challenge before the values become final."

---

#### 9. Federal Bonus Depreciation Changes
**Why It Matters:** 2025 = 100% bonus depreciation impacts book vs. tax gap (from notes)

**Messaging Hook (CFO-level):**
"The phase-out of 100% bonus depreciation impacts the book vs. tax gap on personal property. We're helping [industry] clients optimize their property tax positions in light of the depreciation changes."

---

## Messaging by Trigger

### Trigger 1: Facility Expansion / New Construction

**Subject Line:**
[Company] [City] expansion—personal property tax review?

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw the announcement about [Company]'s new [City, State] facility. Congrats on the expansion.

New construction often triggers personal property assessments that come in 20-40% higher than actual market value—especially in [State] where assessors use statewide depreciation tables that don't reflect industry-specific asset utilization.

We've worked with [Similar Company] and [Similar Company 2] in [Industry] for [X] years managing personal property portfolios across [State]. Before your first assessment notice, worth a 15-minute conversation?

I can offer a free assessment review at the new location to quantify potential savings. Low lift on your end (we just need asset lists and prior renditions).

Open to a brief call next week?

[Your Name]
IVS | Industrial Property Tax Specialists
```

---

### Trigger 2: New Tax Leadership (Job Change)

**Subject Line:**
Congrats on [Company]—one blind spot to review

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw you recently joined [Company] as [Title]—congrats!

As you're getting your arms around the tax function, one area that often gets overlooked is personal property tax on industrial assets. It's specialized (requires engineering + valuation expertise) and time-intensive, so most tax teams either under-optimize or spend too much bandwidth on it.

We manage ~$[X] in personal property for [Industry] companies like [Client 1] and [Client 2]—most for 10+ years. Our typical client saves $500K-$5M annually, and we handle everything from renditions to appeals to assessor relationships.

Happy to provide a free assessment at one of your [State] locations to see if there's opportunity. Takes ~2 weeks, low effort on your end (just asset data), and gives you a quantified savings estimate before any commitment.

Worth a 15-minute intro call?

[Your Name]
IVS | 26 Years in Industrial Property Tax
```

---

### Trigger 3: 10-K Property Tax Mention

**Subject Line:**
[Company] 10-K mention—property tax opportunity?

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company]'s recent 10-K mentions property tax exposure on industrial assets (pg [X]).

We specialize in [Industry] personal property valuations—26 years managing portfolios for companies like [Similar Client] and [Similar Client 2]. Our clients typically see 15-30% reductions on industrial assets through a combination of:

- Correct depreciation schedules (assessors often use generic tables)
- Functional obsolescence documentation (especially for older assets)
- Working with assessors *before* formal appeals (we have positive relationships in [State])

Would you be open to a free assessment at one [State] location? It's a quantified savings estimate with no obligation—gives you data to decide if a broader engagement makes sense.

Brief call next week to discuss?

[Your Name]
IVS | Industrial Property Tax Specialists
```

---

### Trigger 4: M&A / Acquisition

**Subject Line:**
[Acquisition]—property tax review on acquired assets?

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Congrats on the [Company X] acquisition.

One blind spot in M&A due diligence is personal property tax on acquired industrial assets. Ownership changes often trigger county reassessments, and sellers rarely optimize property tax (it's not a priority when selling).

We've helped [Industry] clients review acquired assets post-close and typically find:

- Assets assessed at original cost (not market value)
- Functional obsolescence not documented
- Missed exemptions (especially in [State])

Worth a post-close review at the acquired [City] facility? We can quantify potential savings with no obligation—just a free assessment to see if there's opportunity.

Brief call this week?

[Your Name]
IVS | Industrial Property Tax Specialists
```

---

### Trigger 5: General Outreach (No Specific Trigger)

**Subject Line:**
Property tax optimization for [Company]?

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Most [Industry] tax teams optimize income and sales tax but overlook personal property tax on industrial assets. It's specialized (requires engineering + appraisal expertise), so it often falls through the cracks.

We've managed personal property portfolios for [Industry] companies like [Client 1] and [Client 2] for 10+ years. Typical results:

- 15-30% reductions on industrial assets
- $500K-$5M annual savings (depending on portfolio size)
- Handled end-to-end: renditions, appeals, assessor relationships

Worth a free assessment at one of your [State] locations? Low effort on your end (just asset data), and you get a quantified savings estimate in ~2 weeks with no commitment.

Open to a brief call next week?

**vs. Small Regional Firms:**

## 2025 Legislative Hooks (Messaging Angles)

### Texas: $125K BPP Exemption
**What Changed:** Eliminates tax for 90% of small businesses; per-location relief

**Messaging Hook (for multi-location companies):**
"Texas's new $125K BPP exemption means each of your locations gets relief—worth reviewing your entire portfolio to maximize the benefit."

---

### Florida: Lease Tax Repeal
**What Changed:** Significant cash flow improvement for commercial tenants

**Messaging Hook:**
"Florida's lease tax repeal improves cash flow for commercial tenants. If you're leasing industrial facilities in FL, worth reviewing whether you're also over-assessed on personal property."

---

### Federal: 100% Bonus Depreciation
**What Changed:** Impacts book vs. tax gap and asset lifecycle strategy

**Messaging Hook (CFO-level):**
"The phase-down of 100% bonus depreciation impacts your book-vs-tax gap on personal property. We're helping clients optimize their property tax positions alongside their federal depreciation strategies."

## Next Steps for Clay Implementation

1. **Create three separate Clay tables:**
   - Tier 1 Whale Accounts (50-100 companies)
   - Tier 2 Sweet Spot (200-300 companies)
   - Tier 3 Volume Play (500+ companies)

2. **Enrich each table with:**
   - Decision maker contacts (VP Tax, Tax Director, Manager, CFO, Controller)
   - Intent signals (news, job changes, 10-K mentions)
   - Facility locations (confirm TX/OK/LA/AR/FL presence)

3. **Create lookalike lists from high-value clients:**
   - Environmental Services competitors (Clean Harbors lookalikes)
   - Oil & Gas competitors (HF Sinclair lookalikes)
   - Chemical Mfg competitors (Koppers lookalikes)

4. **Build signal-based sequences:**
   - Sequence 1: Facility expansion trigger
   - Sequence 2: New tax leadership trigger
   - Sequence 3: 10-K property tax mention
   - Sequence 4: M&A trigger
   - Sequence 5: General ICP fit (no specific trigger)

5. **Add current clients to suppression list**

**Questions for IVS Team:**

1. Can you provide the full client list (51 companies) for suppression?
2. Do you have any existing lists of target companies we should prioritize?
3. Are there specific competitors to Clean Harbors/HF Sinclair/Koppers you'd like us to target?
4. Do you have sales/marketing materials we can reference for messaging?
5. What are 2026 expansion priorities (new services, new ICPs, new geographies)?
