## HeyReach (LinkedIn)

### Connection Request

**Option A: No note** (highest accept rate)

**Option B: Short note**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — came across {{company}} while researching property tax in the oilfield services space. Would love to connect.
```

---

### LinkedIn DM #1 (Day 3)

**Version A: Free Review Offer (Equipment angle)**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — quick question.

How is {{company}} handling personal property tax on your equipment? Rigs, pumps, downhole tools — that stuff gets hammered by assessors even when it's worn out or sitting idle.

We do free reviews of recent tax assessments for OFS companies — takes 15 minutes to tell you if there's money on the table.

Want me to take a look?
```

**Version B: Free Review Offer (Regulatory angle)**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — random question for you.

Do your tax assessors account for equipment that's no longer usable due to regulatory changes? Or downtime between jobs?

Most OFS companies I talk to are overpaying because assessors don't understand the industry.

Happy to do a free review of a recent assessment if you want a second opinion.
```

**Version C: Call CTA (Equipment angle)**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — quick question.

Asking because we help OFS companies get those values adjusted. Curious if it's on your radar — worth a quick call?
```

### LinkedIn DM #2 (Optional - Day 7, if no response)

**Version A: Free Review Offer**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — circling back.

We helped an OFS company reduce their personal property valuation by 48% — over $100K in tax savings at one location.

The key was showing assessors that equipment life, downtime, and regulatory obsolescence weren't being factored in.

Happy to do a free review of a recent assessment to see if there's something similar at {{company}}.

## Instantly (Email)

### Email #1: Problem-Focused (Day 5)

**Subject lines (A/B test):**
- Property tax on worn-out equipment?
- Quick question about {{company}}'s equipment tax
- Are your rigs being taxed like they're brand new?

**Version A: Free Review Offer**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: is {{company}} paying property tax on equipment that's worn out, idle, or obsolete?

Most oilfield services companies are. Assessors don't understand the industry — they see a rig or pump fleet and apply standard depreciation, ignoring:

→ Equipment that needs retooling after every job
→ Downtime between deployments
→ Older equipment that's unusable due to regulatory changes
→ Repair costs that eat into actual value

We specialize in personal property tax for capital-intensive industries. Happy to do a free review of a recent assessment — takes about 15 minutes to tell you if there's money on the table.

### Email #2: Case Study / Proof (Day 8)

**Subject:** Re: Property tax on worn-out equipment?

**Version A: Free Review Offer**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

Following up — wanted to share a quick example.

We worked with an oilfield services company facing the same issue: capital-intensive business, equipment constantly in need of repair, and assessors who didn't account for any of it.

Here's what we did:

→ Documented average downtime and repair costs
→ Showed that older equipment was unusable due to regulatory requirements
→ Worked with site personnel to establish actual equipment life

**Result:** 48% reduction in personal property valuation. Over $100,000 in tax savings — at just one location.

If {{company}} has multiple facilities with equipment sitting on the books at inflated values, the math adds up fast.

Happy to do a free review of a recent assessment if you want to see what's there.

### Email #3: Breakup (Day 14)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple times about personal property tax at {{company}}.

Haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:

1. Not a priority right now (fair enough)
2. You've got this handled already (great)
3. My emails got buried (less great)

Either way, I'll stop filling your inbox.

If property tax ever becomes a focus — especially with equipment that's overvalued, idle, or obsolete — we're easy to find. We've helped OFS companies reduce valuations by 40-50% and save hundreds of thousands in taxes.

Good luck with everything at {{company}}.

## Personalization Variables

**Required:**
- `{{first_name}}` — First name
- `{{company}}` — Company name

**Optional (enhanced personalization):**
- `{{equipment_type}}` — Rigs, pump fleets, coiled tubing units, etc.
- `{{location_count}}` — Number of facilities (if known)
- `{{state}}` — Primary operating state (TX, OK, LA, etc.)

**Example enhanced opener:**
```
"I noticed {{company}} operates drilling rigs across Texas and Oklahoma — two states where assessors are notoriously aggressive on equipment valuation."
```

---

## Key Messaging Points

### Pain Points (OFS-specific)
- Equipment needs repair/retooling after every job
- High downtime between deployments
- Regulatory obsolescence (older equipment can't be used)
- Assessors use standard depreciation tables, not industry reality
- Capital-intensive = large tax exposure

### Value Proposition
- We show assessors what equipment is actually worth
- We document downtime, repair costs, regulatory issues
- We work with site personnel who know the equipment
- Typical results: 40-50% valuation reduction

### Proof Points (rotate in emails)

**Case Study 1: Chemical Polymers**
- Challenge: New unit substantially increased the valuation
- What IVS did: Worked with the assessor's office to demonstrate market conditions and current use before noticed values were issued — negated the need for an appeal or hearing
- Result: 25%+ reduction in taxable personal property value

**Case Study 2: Oilfield Services**
- Challenge: Capital-intensive business with equipment needing repair/retooling after every job. Market and regulatory environments change quickly.
- What IVS did: Appealed the valuation and demonstrated older equipment was no longer usable due to regulatory requirements. Worked with property owners and site personnel to determine average downtime, repair costs, and life of downhole equipment.
- Result: 48% decrease in personal property value. Over $100K in tax savings at one location.

## Tone Guidelines

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Voice | Direct, peer-to-peer, industry-aware |
| Length | Short (under 150 words for email) |
| Jargon | Use OFS terms (rigs, downhole, retooling) |
| CTA | Free review offer (primary) or soft call ask (variant) |
| Angle | Problem-aware, not salesy |

### CTA Variants

**Free Review Offer (Primary):**
- "Happy to do a free review of a recent assessment"
- "Want me to take a look?"
- Lower friction — they just send a document
- Good for initial outreach

**Call CTA (Variant):**
- "Worth a quick call?"
- "Worth a 15-minute conversation?"
- Higher intent signal if they respond
- Good for A/B testing against free review
