## Executive Summary

IVS's go-to-market efforts are in the pre-launch phase with no active campaigns currently running across LinkedIn or email channels. This represents a critical opportunity to establish foundational systems and begin prospect engagement to build pipeline momentum.

## Key Highlights

- **Clean slate advantage**: Starting with zero baseline allows for precise tracking and optimization from day one
- **Dual-channel setup**: Both LinkedIn (HeyReach) and email (Instantly) platforms are configured and ready for deployment
- **Strategic timing**: February timing aligns well with Q1 business planning cycles when industrial companies evaluate service providers

## Areas of Concern

- **Zero market presence**: No active outreach means competitors have uncontested access to target prospects
- **Pipeline gap**: Without immediate campaign launch, there will be a 4-6 week delay before seeing qualified meetings
- **Opportunity cost**: Each week of inactivity represents potential lost connections with decision-makers in the industrial valuation space

## Recommendations

- [ ] Launch initial LinkedIn campaign targeting 50 industrial plant managers and CFOs with personalized connection requests focusing on asset valuation pain points
- [ ] Develop and deploy first email sequence (5-touch series) to 100 prospects highlighting recent regulatory changes affecting industrial asset valuations
- [ ] Create compelling case study content showcasing 2-3 recent IVS valuation projects to use as social proof in outreach messages
- [ ] Set up weekly prospect research process to identify 25 new qualified contacts across manufacturing, energy, and chemical sectors
- [ ] Establish response tracking system and book 30-minute strategy call for February 14th to review first week's engagement metrics
