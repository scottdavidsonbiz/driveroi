**Subject:** IVS Update - Jan 23

Hi [Name],

Quick update on where things stand.

**Progress:**
- Email warm-up continues — ~7 days remaining (10 inboxes total, 2 new domains added)
- LinkedIn trigger campaign (Hay Ridge) is live — 7 leads in sequence from industrial acquisition RSS feed
- No acceptances yet, but early — will monitor and adjust if needed

**On Track For:** Email campaign launch ~Jan 30

**Question for you:**
Are there any events or conferences your target customers attend? (IPT, TEI, COST, industry trade shows, etc.)

We can scrape attendee lists and add them to outreach — pre-qualified leads with budget authority.

Let me know if anything comes to mind. Otherwise, talk soon.

—Scott
