3. Do you have existing relationships with any of these companies we should know about?
4. Are there specific competitors to your existing clients you'd like us to prioritize?
5. What's your preferred outreach cadence (how many new conversations can you handle per week)?
6. Do you want us to focus on one industry segment first, or go broad?
