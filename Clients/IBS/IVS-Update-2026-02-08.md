• Decent overall LinkedIn connection volume with **45 total acceptances**

## Recommendations

- [ ] Immediately audit email deliverability - check sender reputation, domain authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), and test inbox placement across major providers
- [ ] Pause underperforming email campaigns until deliverability is resolved to prevent further domain reputation damage
- [ ] Double down on Oilfield Services LinkedIn outreach by increasing daily connection volume and testing new message variations
- [ ] Analyze the one LinkedIn reply from Oilfield Services to identify messaging elements that can be replicated across other campaigns
- [ ] Implement a systematic follow-up sequence for email replies to convert responses into actual meeting bookings
