## Question for IVS

**Event Attendee Lists:**

Are there any industry events or conferences that your target customers typically attend?

Examples might be:
- Property tax conferences
- Industry trade shows (oil & gas, chemical, environmental)
- Tax executive associations (TEI, IPT, etc.)

**Why this matters:** We can scrape attendee lists from these events and add them to the outreach sequence — similar to what we do with other trigger-based prospecting. People who attend these events are pre-qualified and have budget authority.

**Specific events to consider:**
- Institute for Professionals in Taxation (IPT) events
- Tax Executives Institute (TEI) conferences
- Council on State Taxation (COST) meetings
- Industry-specific: NAPE (oil & gas), WEFTEC (environmental), etc.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete email warm-up (~Jan 30)
- [ ] Monitor LinkedIn acceptance rate (adjust messaging if needed)
- [ ] Get event list from IVS for attendee scraping
- [ ] Prepare first email campaign for launch
- [ ] Review suppression list (existing clients, active conversations)
