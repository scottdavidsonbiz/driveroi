# GovEagle Deck - Revised Content (Feb 5, 2026)

**Context:** Brenda flagged the original deck as "not selling enough." Copy edit applied the Seven Sweeps framework. Core shift: from technical demo to business proposal.

**New angle (Feb 5):** GovEagle posted a "Founding GTM Engineer" role ($120-180K + equity). The pitch: DriveROI delivers the infrastructure this role would build, in 30 days, for $18K, while they find the right full-time hire. The JD is a perfect match to what we already built.

---

## Slide 1: Title

**DriveROI x GovEagle**

Your Next 18 High-Fit Accounts Are Already Identified.
Here's How We Found Them.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**You're hiring a Founding GTM Engineer. That hire takes months. Your pipeline can't wait.**

You need someone to build account scoring from USASpending and SAM.gov, create AI-powered outreach workflows, own the sales stack, and set up signal detection.

That's a $120-180K role with a 3-6 month ramp.

Meanwhile, your team is manually researching accounts and guessing who to call.

---

## Slide 3: What We Already Built

**We started the job before the job was posted.**

Without CRM access, onboarding, or a single meeting, we:

1. Pulled 5,000 contract awards from USASpending.gov
2. Scored 1,644 contractors on fit for GovEagle
3. Identified your top 18 accounts, ready to contact
4. Generated personalized outreach for each one

This is what your GTM Engineer's first 3 months would look like. We did it in days.

---

## Slide 4: The Scoring Model

**4-Factor Scoring Model (100 Points)**

- Value Fit (35 pts): Sweet spot $20M-$100M
- Volume (25 pts): Award count = proposal activity
- Agency Diversity (20 pts): Multiple agencies = experienced BD
- Recency (20 pts): Recent awards = active pipeline

Enterprise players (>$500M) deprioritized. They likely have existing tools.

**Your reps stop guessing and start calling the accounts most likely to buy.**

---

## Slide 5: Results

**18 accounts your team can call this week.**

- 5,000 awards analyzed
- 1,644 contractors scored
- 18 Tier A accounts identified

At GovEagle's average deal size, that's $[X] in addressable pipeline from one data pull.

Tier B adds another 351 accounts for nurture sequences.

---

## Slide 6: Top Accounts

**Sample Tier A Accounts**

[Keep existing account table]

These companies have active proposal volume and no automation tool. They're feeling the pain GovEagle solves right now.

---

## Slide 7: Personalized Outreach

**AI-Generated Email Using Account Data**

SUBJECT: 6 awards across 5 agencies, proposal bottlenecks?

Hi [Name],

Noticed Government Acquisitions landed 6 contract awards ($89M) across 5 agencies in the past year.

With that proposal volume, your BD team is likely spending countless hours manually shredding RFPs and building compliance matrices from scratch.

GovEagle automates the compliance analysis and generates proposal outlines, cutting prep time by 40%.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

---

Every email references their specific contract data: award count, dollar value, agency diversity.

This isn't a mail merge. It's personalization that proves you understand their business before the first call.

---

## Slide 8: What Comes Next

**Phase 1 (Done): Account Scoring + Personalized Outreach**
What you're seeing today. Already complete.

**Phase 2 (30 days): Full Infrastructure Build**
SAM.gov integration. Contact enrichment. CRM pipeline setup. Signal detection. Reporting dashboards.
Your GTM Engineer walks into a working system on day one.

**Phase 3 (Ongoing): Managed Operations**
Trigger monitoring. Score updates. New account identification monthly. Pipeline reporting.
We run it until your hire is ramped, then hand it off.

---

## Slide 9: What You Get

**Foundation Build: $18,000 (30 days)**

- Account scoring model calibrated to your ICP (USASpending + SAM.gov)
- CRM configured with scored pipeline and routing
- 5 Clay enrichment workflows (contact data, firmographics, triggers)
- Signal detection: new contract awards, job postings, press releases
- Reporting dashboards: pipeline by tier, conversion by source
- 20 personalized outreach templates ready to send

**Optional: Managed Ops at $7,500/month**
We run the infrastructure until your GTM Engineer is hired and ramped. Monthly scoring refresh, data cleanup, workflow optimization, business review.

**The math:** $18K build + 3 months managed ops ($22.5K) = $40.5K total.
Your GTM Engineer hire: $120-180K salary + 3-6 months to build what we deliver in 30 days.
We're not replacing the hire. We're making sure they succeed from day one.

---

## Slide 10: Next Steps

1. You tell us if these 18 accounts are the right fit
2. We refine the scoring model based on your feedback
3. We start the 30-day infrastructure build while you hire

The scored account list is yours to keep regardless.

You own everything we build. No vendor lock-in. When your GTM Engineer starts, they inherit a working system, not a blank slate.
